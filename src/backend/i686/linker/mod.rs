//! Native i686 (32-bit x86) ELF linker.
//!
//! Reads ELF32 relocatable object files (.o) and archives (.a), resolves
//! symbols against system shared libraries, applies i386 relocations, and
//! produces a dynamically-linked ELF32 executable.
//!
//! Supported relocations:
//! - R_386_32 (absolute 32-bit)
//! - R_386_PC32 (PC-relative 32-bit)
//! - R_386_PLT32 (PLT-relative, same as PC32 for defined symbols)
//! - R_386_GOTPC (PC-relative offset to GOT base)
//! - R_386_GOTOFF (offset from GOT base)
//! - R_386_GOT32X (relaxable GOT entry reference)
//! - R_386_GOT32 (GOT entry reference)
//! - R_386_NONE (no-op)
