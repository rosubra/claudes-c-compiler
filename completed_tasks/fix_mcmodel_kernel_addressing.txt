Task: Fix mcmodel=kernel global address emission
Status: completed
Branch: fix-mcmodel-kernel-addressing

Problem:
  emit_global_addr used RIP-relative addressing (leaq symbol(%rip), %rax) for all code
  models including -mcmodel=kernel. In the Linux kernel, expressions like
  (_text - __START_KERNEL_map) require the link-time virtual address of _text,
  not the RIP-relative runtime address. This caused arch/x86/kernel/head64.c to
  be miscompiled, producing incorrect load_delta computation and boot failure.

Fix:
  Changed emit_global_addr to use absolute addressing (movq $symbol, %rax) when
  code_model_kernel is true. This generates R_X86_64_32S relocations matching GCC
  behavior. Kernel code that needs runtime physical addresses (early boot code)
  uses RIP_REL_REF() with inline asm that bypasses emit_global_addr entirely.

Files changed:
  src/backend/x86/codegen/codegen.rs - emit_global_addr function
  tests/mcmodel-kernel-rip-relative-x86/main.c - updated comment
  tests/mcmodel-kernel-global-addr-arithmetic-x86/ - new regression test
