Task: Convert emit_fmt calls to fast-path direct buffer writes
Status: done
Agent: compile_speed
Started: 2026-01-27
Completed: 2026-01-27

Goal: Convert ~280+ emit_fmt/format! calls in x86 codegen to use fast-path
direct buffer writes (emit_instr_imm_reg, emit_instr_reg_reg, etc.) to
reduce ~3% of total compilation time spent in core::fmt infrastructure.

Result: Converted 265/360 emit_fmt calls to fast-path method calls.
Added 8 new fast-path methods to common.rs. Remaining 95 calls are complex
patterns not suited for simple method dispatch (dynamic mnemonics, RIP-relative,
seg_prefix, lock prefix atomics, x87 FP stack, etc.)

Performance: ~2.4% codegen speedup (median 0.503s -> 0.491s on sqlite3.c)
Correctness: Bit-for-bit identical assembly output verified.
Tests: 519/529 integration tests pass (same as baseline), 159/160 unit tests pass (same).

Key files:
- src/backend/common.rs (fast-path infrastructure, 8 new methods)
- src/backend/x86/codegen/codegen.rs (265 calls converted)
