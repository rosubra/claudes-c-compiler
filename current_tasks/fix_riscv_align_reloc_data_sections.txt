Fix: R_RISCV_ALIGN relocations should not be emitted in data sections

The RISC-V assembler emits R_RISCV_ALIGN relocations for .balign/.align
directives in ALL sections, including data sections like .export_symbol.
This causes the kernel modpost tool to fail with "local symbol was exported"
errors because modpost processes R_RISCV_ALIGN relocs (which have sym=0)
as if they were real symbol references.

R_RISCV_ALIGN should only be emitted in executable sections (SHF_EXECINSTR)
where linker relaxation can change code sizes. In data sections, alignment
is static and doesn't need relocations.
