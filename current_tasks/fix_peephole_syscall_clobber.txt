Fix peephole optimizer: syscall/sysenter instructions not invalidating clobbered registers

The x86 peephole store-forwarding pass does not recognize `syscall` or `sysenter`
instructions as implicit register clobberers. The syscall instruction clobbers rcx
(return RIP) and r11 (saved RFLAGS), and sysenter clobbers similar registers.

This causes the peephole to forward stale register values across syscall instructions
embedded in inline asm blocks, producing incorrect code.

Fix: Add syscall/sysenter/int to the has_indirect_memory_access barrier list in
types.rs, matching the existing handling for rdmsr/cpuid/rdtsc.

Failing tests: asm-syscall-x86-003-run2 (val_a corruption across syscall clobber)
