Fix CType::size() returning 0 and typedef function pointer return type misclassification

Three related bugs fixed:

1. sizeof_member_access (expr_types.rs): Used CType::size() which returns 0 for
   struct/union fields. Fixed to use resolve_ctype_size().

2. sizeof_expr for FunctionCall (expr_types.rs): Used CType::size() which returns 0
   for struct-returning function calls. Fixed to use resolve_ctype_size().

3. build_function_pointer_ctype_from_typedef (types.rs): Did not add the spurious
   Pointer wrapper to the return type CType. This caused extract_func_ptr_return_ctype's
   peel_ctype_ptr_wrapper to strip the ACTUAL return-type pointer (e.g., for
   typedef const struct S *(*fn_t)(args)), exposing a bare Struct CType.
   get_call_return_struct_size then misclassified the call as sret, corrupting the ABI.
   Fixed by wrapping the return CType in Pointer() to match the convention.

Impact:
- Fixes jq (all 12 tests now pass - was 0/12)
- Fixes first sqlite3 crash (VFS function table corruption via misclassified sret)
- Fixes sizeof for struct member access and struct-returning function calls

Status: IN PROGRESS
