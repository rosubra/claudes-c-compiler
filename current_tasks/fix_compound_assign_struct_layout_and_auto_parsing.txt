Fix two bugs:

1. CompoundAssign/Assign in get_pointed_struct_layout resolves struct layout
   from the RHS instead of LHS, causing segfaults when (ptr += N)->field[i]
   accesses an array field through a compound-assigned pointer.

2. Parser trailing type specifier collection does not handle 'auto' storage
   class interleaved with type specifiers (e.g., "double auto long const").
   This causes parse errors on valid C code.
