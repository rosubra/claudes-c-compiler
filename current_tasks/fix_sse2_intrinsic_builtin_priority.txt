Task: Fix SSE2 intrinsic builtin priority (postgres x86 crash)
Status: in_progress
Description: The compiler crashes when compiling postgres on x86 because
_mm_set1_epi8 and other SSE2 intrinsics from emmintrin.h are not intercepted
as builtins. Instead, the compiler inlines their wrapper bodies which call
__builtin_ia32_vec_init_v16qi (registered as Nop, returns 0), leading to
NULL pointer dereference via __CCC_M128I_FROM_BUILTIN(0).

Fix: Modified try_lower_builtin_call to not let the is_defined guard bypass
intrinsic builtins registered in the builtin table (since those definitions
are from our own headers, not user overrides).
