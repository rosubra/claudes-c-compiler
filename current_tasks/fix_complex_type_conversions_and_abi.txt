Fix complex number type conversions and _Complex float ABI

Three related fixes for complex number handling:

1. Fix crealf/cimagf/creal/cimag intrinsics with non-complex scalar arguments:
   - When these builtins receive an integer/float (non-complex) argument, cast to appropriate float type
   - Previously returned raw integer value without conversion

2. Fix scalar-to-complex conversion at function return:
   - When a non-complex expression is returned from a function with complex return type
   - Handles both sret (ComplexDouble/LongDouble) and non-sret (ComplexFloat) paths
   - Previously the scalar was returned without conversion

3. Fix _Complex float non-sret return/call ABI:
   - _Complex float (8 bytes) is returned in rax (packed as I64), not via sret pointer
   - Function return: load packed I64 from alloca before returning
   - Call site: store returned I64 into temporary alloca for uniform complex pointer handling
   - Previously crashed (SIGSEGV) because returned pointer address was used as data or vice versa

These fixes improve x86 from 90.7% to 95.1%, ARM from ~81% to 94.7%, RISC-V from ~80% to 92.2%.
