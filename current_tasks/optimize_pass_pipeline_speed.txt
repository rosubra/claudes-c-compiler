Task: Optimize the optimization pass pipeline for faster compilation

Goal: Reduce compile time by making the IR optimization pass pipeline smarter
about skipping unnecessary work in later iterations.

Changes:
1. Per-pass dirty tracking: Track which passes made changes. In later iterations,
   skip passes that found nothing in the previous iteration AND whose upstream
   passes also found nothing (so no new opportunities could have been created).
2. Early exit on diminishing returns: If iteration N produces < 0.1% of iteration 0's
   changes, skip iteration N+1.
3. Reuse CFG analysis between GVN, LICM, and if_convert within the same iteration
   (no CFG-modifying pass runs between them).

Status: in_progress
