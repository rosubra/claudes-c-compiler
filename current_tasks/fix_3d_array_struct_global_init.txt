Fix 3D (and higher dimensional) array of structs/unions global initializer bug.

When initializing a multi-dimensional array of structs as a global variable,
brace groups that contain flat initializer lists for sub-arrays don't properly
fill all elements. For example:

    struct S { int a; int b; };
    struct S arr[2][2][2] = {
        { {1,2, 3,4}, {5,6, 7,8} },
        { {9,10, 11,12}, {13,14, 15,16} }
    };

The inner brace group {1,2, 3,4} should initialize arr[0][0][0]={1,2} and
arr[0][0][1]={3,4}, but our compiler only initializes the first struct in each
sub-array. The bug is in the global initializer code (likely in lowering/global_init.rs).

This is a cross-backend bug (affects x86, arm, riscv equally) since it's in the
frontend/IR lowering code.
