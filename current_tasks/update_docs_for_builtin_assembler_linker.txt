Update all documentation to reflect the builtin assembler and linker backends.

The docs currently claim that assembly and linking delegate to an external GCC
toolchain. This is no longer true: all four architectures (x86-64, i686, AArch64,
RISC-V) now have fully functional builtin assemblers and linkers, activated via
MY_ASM=builtin and MY_LD=builtin.

Changes:
- Rewrite top-level README.md to fix assembler/linker claims
- Remove project build list and testing pipeline discussion from README
- Update backend/README.md with builtin assembler/linker documentation
- Write design-doc quality explanations for all major subsystems
- Add architecture diagrams showing how components fit together
- Remove completed idea files (native_elf_writer.txt)
