Task: Fix FAM string literal init and multi-dimensional array flat init in global structs
Status: In progress

Problems fixed:
1. String literal initializing a flexible array member (FAM) char[] field was not
   being written - the bytes buffer was allocated too small and the string content
   was not copied.
   Example: struct { char *p; char data[]; } s = {0, "hello"};
   Bug: s.data was empty instead of "hello"

2. Multi-dimensional array fields in structs were not correctly initialized when
   using flat initializer values. Only the first element of each outermost sub-array
   was being written.
   Example: struct { int arr[2][2][2]; } s = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 };
   Bug: Only arr[0][0][0]=1, arr[1][0][0]=2 were set, rest was 0

3. Braced flat init for multi-dimensional arrays of structs was distributing values
   incorrectly, treating each value as a whole struct instead of filling struct fields.

Root causes:
- compute_fam_extra_size: did not account for string literal length
- fill_fam_field: did not handle Expr::StringLiteral for char FAM
- fill_array_field: did not flatten multi-dimensional array types when
  distributing flat scalar/struct initializers
