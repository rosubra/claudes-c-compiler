Task: Fix typeof resolution through anonymous struct/union members

Bug: typeof(s.field) where 'field' is accessed through an anonymous struct
inside a union incorrectly falls back to int (4 bytes) instead of resolving
the actual field type.

Example:
  struct S {
      union {
          struct {
              void *ptr;  // Should be 8 bytes
          };
      };
  };
  struct S s;
  typeof(s.ptr) x;  // BUG: sizeof(x) == 4 (treated as int), should be 8

This affects the typeof-anon-union-member test and is needed for Linux kernel
per_cpu macro patterns.

Plan:
1. Find where typeof resolves member access types in sema or lowering
2. Fix the path through anonymous struct/union members
3. Verify the typeof-anon-union-member test passes
4. Run regression tests
