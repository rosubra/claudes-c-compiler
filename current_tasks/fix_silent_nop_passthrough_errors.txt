Task: Convert silent NOP/passthrough stubs to proper errors in assembler/linker backends

All backends have cases where unknown instructions, directives, or relocations are
silently ignored or emit NOPs instead of raising errors. This causes silent corruption
which is far worse than compiler errors.

Changes:
1. RISC-V linker: unknown relocations silently skipped -> error
2. x86 linker: unknown relocations warned but continued -> error
3. i686 linker: unknown relocations warned but continued -> error
4. AArch64 linker: unknown relocations warned but continued -> error
5. RISC-V assembler: unknown directives silently ignored -> error
6. AArch64 assembler: unknown directives mapped to Ignored -> error
7. x86 linker: GOTTPOFF relaxation fallback -> error
8. RISC-V linker: missing input files silently skipped -> error
