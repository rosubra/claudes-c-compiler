Fix complex/real mixed-type promotion per C11 6.3.1.8

Bug: When mixing _Complex float with double in arithmetic (e.g., complex_float - double),
expr_ctype() returned _Complex float instead of _Complex double. This caused the result
to be treated as _Complex float (8 bytes) while the actual computation produced a
_Complex double (16 bytes), leading to corrupted values.

Fix:
1. expr_ctype() in complex.rs: properly apply common_complex_type() for all binary ops
   involving at least one complex operand, not just when the RHS is complex.
2. usual_arithmetic_conversion() in expr_types.rs: properly rank both operands' real
   types (per C11 6.3.1.8) instead of checking complex types in isolation.
