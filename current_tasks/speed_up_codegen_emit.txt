Task: Speed up codegen assembly text emission

Problem:
Profiling shows the codegen phase (including peephole) is the biggest single phase at 0.346s
for sqlite3.c (19.6MB of assembly text). The emit_fmt path uses Rust's std::fmt machinery
which has overhead (vtable dispatch, itoa via Display, buffer growth checks). Additionally,
BlockId::as_label() allocates a String on every call (thousands of times per compilation).

Plan:
1. Add a fast integer-to-buffer writer (itoa) that bypasses core::fmt overhead
2. Add emit_label/emit_block_label fast paths to AsmOutput that avoid format_args! overhead
3. Eliminate String allocations from BlockId::as_label() by using Display + format_args! directly
4. Add specialized emit methods for common patterns (movq offset(%rbp), %reg etc.)
5. Pre-format BlockId labels once per function instead of per-use

Status: IN PROGRESS
