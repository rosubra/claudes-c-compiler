Task: Fix RISC-V kernel verify to enable FPU and attempt defconfig

Problem: The verify_kernel.py script uses tinyconfig for RISC-V which does not
enable CONFIG_FPU. The busybox-riscv64 binary is built with double-float ABI
(flags 0x5) and uses FP instructions (e.g., C.FSD = 0xb920). Without FPU support
in the kernel, busybox gets SIGILL (signal 4) at the first FP instruction.

The kernel builds and boots fine, but init (busybox) crashes immediately.

Fix:
1. Copy verify_kernel.py to a writable location and add "FPU" to RISC-V required_opts
2. Test that tinyconfig + FPU boots successfully (confirmed)
3. Attempt defconfig build for broader coverage

Status: in_progress
