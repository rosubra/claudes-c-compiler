Implement SSE intrinsic builtins needed for PostgreSQL build.

PostgreSQL's build fails at link time with undefined references to:
- __builtin_ia32_movnti64 (non-temporal store i64)
- __builtin_ia32_movntdq (non-temporal store 128-bit)
- __builtin_ia32_movntpd (non-temporal store packed double)
- __builtin_ia32_clflush (cache line flush)
- __builtin_ia32_lfence (load fence)
- __builtin_ia32_mfence (memory fence)

These come from GCC's emmintrin.h being parsed. The fix involves:
1. Provide bundled SSE intrinsic headers (emmintrin.h, xmmintrin.h, etc.)
   that define __m128i/__m128d types and _mm_* functions using our builtins
2. Register __builtin_ia32_* functions in sema/builtins.rs
3. Lower them in IR to appropriate instructions
4. Encode SSE instructions (MOVNTDQ, MOVNTI, MFENCE, etc.) in x86 backend
5. Add bundled include path to preprocessor (searched before system GCC headers)
