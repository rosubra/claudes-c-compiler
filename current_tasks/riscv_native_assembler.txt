Task: Implement native RISC-V assembler

Goal: Write a built-in RISC-V assembler that can parse .s files generated by the
RISC-V backend and produce ELF .o object files, replacing the need for
riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc as an external assembler.

This includes:
- Parser for RISC-V assembly (.s format as emitted by our codegen)
- RISC-V instruction encoder (RV64GC instruction set)
- ELF object file writer with proper relocations
- Integration via MY_ASM or built-in assembler path
- scripts/compare_asm.py for comparing output with GCC assembler

Status: in progress
