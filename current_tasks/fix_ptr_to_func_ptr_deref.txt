Fix pointer-to-function-pointer dereference generating no-op instead of load.

Status: IN PROGRESS

Bug: Dereferencing int (**fpp)(int, int) was treated as a no-op (like *fp for
direct function pointers) instead of emitting a Load instruction. This caused
segfaults when calling through dereferenced pointer-to-function-pointers.

Root cause: CType representation absorbs extra pointer levels into the function
return type, making Pointer(Pointer(Function(...))) look like
Pointer(Function(...)). Multiple places checked CType shape to decide if deref
was a no-op without accounting for this ambiguity.

Fix: Added is_ptr_to_func_ptr flag to VarInfo, computed from derived declarator
pointer count. Used in is_function_pointer_deref and emit_call_instruction to
correctly identify ptr-to-fptr variables. Removed Function(_) from
pointee_is_no_load to let is_function_pointer_deref handle all function pointer
deref decisions.
