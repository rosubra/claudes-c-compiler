Task: Division by Constant Strength Reduction

Add strength reduction for integer division and modulo by constants to the
IR simplify pass. This converts extremely slow div/idiv instructions (20-90
cycles on x86) into fast multiply+shift sequences (3-5 cycles).

Optimizations to implement:
1. Unsigned division by constant: x / C => multiply-high by magic number + shift
2. Signed division by power-of-2: x / 2^k => arithmetic shift with bias correction
3. Signed division by constant: x / C => multiply-high by magic number + adjust
4. Unsigned/signed modulo by constant: x % C => x - (x / C) * C

This is an IR-level optimization that benefits all three backends (x86, ARM, RISC-V).
