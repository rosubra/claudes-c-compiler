Fix function pointer dereference bug

When dereferencing a function pointer with (*fp)(args), the compiler generates
an actual memory load instruction instead of treating it as a no-op. In C,
dereferencing a function pointer yields a function designator which immediately
decays back to a function pointer (C standard 6.3.2.1). So (*fp)(args) should
be equivalent to fp(args).

This causes crashes in many projects that use the (*fp)(args) calling pattern,
including lemon, http-parser, and many others.
