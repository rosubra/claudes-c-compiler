Task: Fix struct pointer member array subscript element size

Fix: In get_member_array_elem_size (lvalue.rs), when a struct member is a pointer
type (e.g., `struct S *ring`), the array subscript stride was not being computed.
Only CType::Array fields were handled, not CType::Pointer fields.

For `ep.ring[i]` where `ring` is `struct S *` and `struct S { unsigned int next; }`,
the element size should be sizeof(struct S) = 4 bytes. But the code fell through
to the default of 8 (pointer size), causing incorrect memory addressing.

Added CType::Pointer(pointee) handling in both MemberAccess and PointerMemberAccess
arms, using pointee.size() to get the correct element stride.

Impact: Fixes struct array indexing through pointer members, affecting many
gcc_torture tests that use patterns like `ep->ring[i].field`.

Status: In Progress
