Task: Wire DiagnosticEngine into the IR lowering phase

Status: in_progress

Problem:
The IR lowering phase has zero access to DiagnosticEngine. It currently handles
errors silently via Option<T> fallbacks or panics via unreachable!(). The parser
and sema phases both use DiagnosticEngine for structured error reporting, but the
lowerer does not.

Plan:
1. Add DiagnosticEngine field to the Lowerer struct
2. Thread it from the driver through to the lowerer
3. Replace key silent fallbacks with proper diagnostic emissions
4. Add diagnostic reporting for unresolved typeof expressions and other gaps
5. Update the ideas/low_structured_error_infrastructure.txt to reflect progress
