Fix flat struct initialization for array fields.

When a struct contains an array field and is initialized with a flat (non-braced) initializer list,
the compiler should consume multiple items from the init list to fill the array elements.

Currently it only consumes 1 item for the entire array field.

Example:
  struct { double a; int b[10]; double c; } x = {1.0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 0, 11.0};
  // Should give: a=1.0, b={2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,0}, c=11.0

This affects both local and global struct initialization.
Also need to fix for multi-dimensional array fields within structs.
