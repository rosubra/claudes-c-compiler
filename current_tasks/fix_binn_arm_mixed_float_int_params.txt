Fix ARM codegen: mixed float/int param clobbering in prologue.

When a function has float params (spilled via fmov to stack) and integer params
whose allocas were promoted by mem2reg, the integer param in x0 gets clobbered
when the body code loads the float param's stack slot back into x0 (the ARM
scratch register). Fix: add param pre-store in ARM prologue (like x86 already has)
to save promoted GP params to callee-saved registers before any body code runs.

Example: test_func(float A, float B, int maxUlps) - maxUlps in x0 gets clobbered.
Project: binn (AlmostEqualFloats assertion failure on ARM).
