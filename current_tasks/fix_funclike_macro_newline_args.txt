Task: Fix function-like macro expansion when arguments span newlines

Bug: The preprocessor fails to expand function-like macros when there's a newline
between the macro name and its opening parenthesis. For example:
    #define FOO(x) (x+1)
    FOO
      (10)
The second invocation is not expanded, resulting in "FOO\n  (10)" in the output.

The C standard requires that whitespace (including newlines) between a function-like
macro name and its opening "(" be ignored during expansion.

This causes issues with glibc headers (e.g., __attribute_deprecated_msg__ in signal.h)
where the macro invocation is split across lines, which is common in system headers.

Fix: In the preprocessor's macro expansion logic, when encountering a function-like
macro name, look ahead past newlines/whitespace to find the opening parenthesis.

Status: In progress
