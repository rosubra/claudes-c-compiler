Refactoring the 774-line lower_local_decl spaghetti function in stmt.rs.

Changes:
1. Extract shared DeclAnalysis struct for declaration type computation
   (duplicated between lower_local_decl and lower_global_decl)
2. Split lower_local_decl into focused sub-functions:
   - lower_local_typedef()
   - lower_local_extern()
   - lower_local_function_proto()
   - lower_local_static()
   - lower_local_variable() (alloca + init)
   - lower_init_list_array() (the 193-line array init block)
3. Extract LocalInfo/GlobalInfo builder helpers to reduce 15-field boilerplate
4. Fix duplicated typedef resolution (should call existing resolve_typedef_derived)
5. Extract repeated lower_call_arguments pattern (4x identical Identifier matches)
