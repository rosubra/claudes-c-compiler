Task: Fix if-conversion pass speculating loads past null-pointer guards

Problem:
The if-conversion pass (passes/if_convert.rs) treats Load instructions as side-effect-free
in is_side_effect_free(). While loads don't have write side effects, they CAN TRAP
(segfault) on invalid pointers. When the pass hoists loads from conditional arms into
unconditional code, it speculatively executes loads that were originally guarded by
null-pointer checks.

This causes postgres initdb to segfault in validate_zone() at:
  if (!tzname || !tzname[0])
      return false;
The short-circuit OR gets lowered to a diamond where one arm loads tzname[0].
If-conversion hoists this load unconditionally, so when tzname is NULL, it crashes.

Fix:
1. Remove Instruction::Load from is_side_effect_free()
2. Add regression test with null-pointer guard + short-circuit OR pattern
3. Verify postgres initdb no longer segfaults
