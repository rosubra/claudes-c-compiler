Task: Add store-to-load forwarding to the GVN pass
Status: in_progress

The GVN pass currently does Load CSE (two loads from the same pointer without
intervening memory clobber are de-duplicated), but does NOT forward stored values
to subsequent loads.

That is, after:
  store V -> *P
  ... (no memory clobber) ...
  %x = load *P

The load of *P should be replaced with a Copy of V, since we know the value
at *P is V.

This is a common pattern in C code (struct field initialization followed by
reads, local variable writes/reads, etc.) and will eliminate redundant loads
across all backends.

The implementation will:
1. Track Store instructions in the GVN state (pointer -> stored value)
2. On Load, check if we have a stored value for that pointer
3. If so, replace the load with the stored value (type-matched)
4. Properly invalidate stored value tracking on memory clobbers
5. Include proper rollback support for dominator-tree DFS scoping
