Fix ARM defconfig kernel boot failure

The ARM (aarch64) kernel built with ccc-arm passes compilation but
fails to boot in QEMU - no serial output at all, suggesting a very
early crash.

x86 defconfig passes, RISC-V defconfig passes, ARM defconfig fails.
ARM tinyconfig also fails.

Using delta debugging to identify the file(s) causing the boot failure.
