Task: Add "In file included from" include trace diagnostics

Status: in_progress

Description:
Implement GCC-style "In file included from file:line" traces in error diagnostics.
When an error occurs in an included header, the compiler should show the full include
chain so users can understand where the error originated.

Changes planned:
1. Add include chain tracking to SourceManager (mapping files to their include parents)
2. Parse include chain info from preprocessor line markers (flag 1 = start of include,
   flag 2 = return from include)
3. Render "In file included from X:Y:" notes in DiagnosticEngine before errors in headers
4. Add location info to preprocessor errors/warnings so they get proper file:line:col
