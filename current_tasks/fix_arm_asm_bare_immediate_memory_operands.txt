Fix ARM assembler: support bare immediate offsets in memory operands (without # prefix)

ARM assembly allows memory operands like [sp, -16]! and [x0, 8] without the # prefix
for immediates. Our parser currently requires # and misparses bare numbers as register
names (MemRegOffset instead of MemPreIndex/Mem).

This blocks musl ARM build (crti.s uses `stp x29,x30,[sp,-16]!`).

Also fix the mbedtls RISC-V parse error with very long initializer arrays,
and add missing i686 aesdec/aesenc instructions for mbedtls.
