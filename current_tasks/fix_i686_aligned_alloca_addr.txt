Fix i686 over-aligned alloca address computation

Status: in_progress

Changes:
1. src/backend/i686/codegen/memory.rs - Fixed emit_alloca_aligned_addr_impl and
   emit_alloca_aligned_addr_to_acc_impl to use alloca_over_align(val_id) instead of
   (-slot.0) for alignment derivation. The bug produced wrong AND masks for ALIGN64
   variables (e.g., 0xFFFFFF74 instead of 0xFFFFFFC0), corrupting stack memory.

2. src/ir/lowering/stmt.rs - Propagate type natural alignment to alloca instructions,
   taking max(explicit_align, type_align).

3. src/backend/i686/codegen/prologue.rs - Fixed bias calculation for omit-frame-pointer
   mode: use 12 instead of 8 when frame pointer is omitted.

Testing:
- wolfssl i686 AES-GCM test now passes (was segfaulting)
- Full regression suite: no regressions (libsodium x86/arm/riscv failures are pre-existing)
