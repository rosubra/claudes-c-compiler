Fix RISC-V defconfig build: inline asm emits 0 instead of symbol for always_inline

The RISC-V defconfig kernel build fails on mm/page_alloc.c because the
arch_static_branch always_inline function emits ".dword 0 - ." instead
of ".dword symbol_name - ." in __jump_table sections.

Root cause: When the inliner's always_inline budget is exhausted, small
always_inline callees (like arch_static_branch with 14 instructions,
3 blocks) are skipped because select_inline_site only allows tiny callees
(<=5 instructions) when budget_exhausted is true. This leaves a standalone
arch_static_branch body with unresolvable "i" constraint operands that
emit 0 as a placeholder.

Fix: In select_inline_site, allow small always_inline callees to be inlined
even when the budget is exhausted, since they are correctness-critical
(the "i" constraint requires a resolved symbol reference).
