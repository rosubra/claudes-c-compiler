Fix dead code elimination and __attribute__((error)) for kernel compilation
=============================================================================

Problem: net/core/filter.c fails with linker errors for undefined symbols
__siphash_aligned and __bad_mask when compiled with ccc.

Root cause: The kernel uses static inline functions with __builtin_constant_p()
guards and IS_ENABLED() macros that create patterns like `if (1 || expr)`.
After short-circuit evaluation lowering (alloca/store/CondBranch/load) and
mem2reg, phi nodes with a single incoming edge remain non-simplified. This
prevents constant propagation from folding outer conditionals, leaving dead
code paths that reference undefined external functions.

Additionally, functions declared with __attribute__((error("msg"))) (like
__bad_mask) are compile-time assertion traps that should never be called at
runtime. The compiler lacked support for this attribute.

Fix approach (three changes):

1. Trivial phi simplification in cfg_simplify: After dead block removal,
   phi nodes may have only one incoming edge or all-same incoming values.
   These are replaced with Copy instructions, enabling further constant
   propagation and dead code elimination.

2. Dead static function elimination: After all optimization passes, remove
   static functions that are never referenced (no Call or GlobalAddr
   instructions target them). This eliminates unreachable static inline
   function bodies that would otherwise cause linker errors.

3. __attribute__((error/warning)) support: Parse the error/warning
   attributes on function declarations. During IR lowering, calls to
   error-attributed functions emit Unreachable terminators instead of
   actual calls, treating them as dead code.

Test: tests/dead-code-const-or validates that `if (1 || expr)` properly
eliminates dead code paths through the phi simplification chain.
