Fix RISC-V call staging to use only caller-saved temporaries (t3/t4/t5).

Previously, emit_call_reg_args staged arguments into t3/t4/t5 plus s2-s6
for calls with >3 GP register arguments. The s-registers are callee-saved,
forcing them to be saved/restored in prologue/epilogue and preventing their
use for register allocation. This contributed to 2.27x stack frame bloat
vs GCC in the RISC-V kernel.

Now uses a 3-phase approach: stage first 3 GP args into t3/t4/t5, move
them to target a-registers, then load remaining GP args directly into
their target a-registers. This frees s2-s6 for the register allocator,
reducing callee-saved register pressure and stack frame sizes.

Results:
- Average RISC-V kernel stack frame: 128.9 -> 125.7 bytes (~2.5% reduction)
- Unit tests: x86 100.0%, ARM 99.8%, RISC-V 99.9%, i686 99.9%
- Projects: 47/48 passed (mbedtls ARM failure is pre-existing)
- Kernel defconfig: x86 PASS, RISC-V PASS
- ARM kernel defconfig: FAIL (pre-existing, confirmed by testing at b784ad5f)

Note: RISC-V kernel still overflows during networking (IPv6 DAD, interrupt handlers).
Further stack reduction requires add_riscv_caller_saved_regalloc (locked by another
agent) which would make t3/t4/t5 available for general register allocation and have
a much larger impact on frame sizes.
