Sync __has_builtin() preprocessor list with all implemented builtins

The preprocessor's is_supported_builtin() function (used for __has_builtin() checks)
only lists ~126 builtins, but the compiler actually implements ~280 builtins.

This means __has_builtin(__builtin_add_overflow) returns 0 even though the compiler
supports it, causing real-world code (Linux kernel, glibc) to take fallback paths.

Fix: Add all missing implemented builtins to is_supported_builtin(), including:
- Overflow-checking arithmetic (21 builtins)
- Math functions (sin, cos, log, exp, pow, floor, ceil, round, etc.)
- Type queries (classify_type, object_size)
- Complex number functions (conj, complex)
- Atomic builtins (nand, non-_n variants, fence, lock-free)
- Compiler hints (choose_expr, prefetch, clear_cache)
- x86 SSE/AES-NI intrinsics
