When MY_LD is set, call ld directly instead of going through GCC.
This means we need to:
- Find and add CRT objects (crt1.o, crti.o, crtn.o, crtbegin.o, crtend.o)
- Add proper library search paths (-L)
- Convert -Wl, flags to direct ld flags
- Add -m elf_x86_64 emulation
- Add dynamic linker path
- Handle -nostdlib, -shared, -r, -static cases
Starting with x86 backend only.
