Unify all optimization levels (-O0, -O1, -O2, -O3, -Os, -Oz) to always run
the maximum set of optimizations. The compiler is still in development and
having multiple optimization levels creates hard-to-find bugs. All levels
will behave identically until the compiler is mature enough to warrant
separate tiers.
