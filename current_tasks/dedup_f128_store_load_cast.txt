Deduplicate F128 store/load/cast dispatch between ARM and RISC-V backends.

The emit_store, emit_load, emit_store_with_const_offset, emit_load_with_const_offset,
and emit_cast F128 paths are structurally identical between ARM and RISC-V codegen.rs,
differing only in register names and instruction mnemonics (~300 lines of duplication).

Plan: extend the existing F128SoftFloat trait with shared orchestration functions for
the SlotAddr dispatch pattern, then refactor both backends to call these shared functions.
