Implement _Static_assert / static_assert Evaluation
=====================================================
Status: completed

The parser currently skips _Static_assert declarations entirely without
evaluating the condition expression. This means _Static_assert(0, "fail")
compiles silently when it should be a compile error.

The kernel uses 988 static_assert() calls. While they happen to be all
true (otherwise gcc would have caught them), missing this means our compiler
doesn't catch type/size constraint violations.

Plan:
1. Parse _Static_assert(expr, "msg") properly at both file and block scope
2. Evaluate the constant expression using eval_const_int_expr
3. Emit a compile error if the expression is false (zero)
4. Support C23 single-argument form: _Static_assert(expr)
5. Remove the now-unnecessary static_assert preprocessor macro
