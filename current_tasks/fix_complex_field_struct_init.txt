Task: Fix complex field initialization in struct/array initializers

Problem:
Complex type fields (ComplexFloat, ComplexDouble, ComplexLongDouble) in struct
and array initializers are falling through to the scalar handler, which treats
them as IrType::Ptr (8 bytes) instead of properly handling them as aggregate
values (8/16/32 bytes).

This causes:
- Global struct initializers: only 8 bytes written for complex fields instead of
  the correct size, corrupting subsequent fields
- Local struct initializers: stores pointer value instead of copying complex data
- Designated initializers with complex fields: same issues as above

Fixes needed:
1. In global_init.rs fill_struct_global_bytes: add match arm for complex types
   that uses eval_complex_const to get (real, imag) and writes both components
2. In stmt.rs emit_struct_init / lower_local_struct_init: add match arm for
   complex types that uses Memcpy to copy complex data from source to dest field
3. In global_init.rs write_struct_init_to_bytes: handle complex fields properly

Status: In progress
