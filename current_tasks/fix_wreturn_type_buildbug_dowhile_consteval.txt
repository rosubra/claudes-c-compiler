Fix -Wreturn-type false positives: BUILD_BUG(), do-while body divergence, constant eval, builtins

These are the remaining -Wreturn-type false positives blocking the Linux kernel build
AFTER switch exhaustiveness (which is being handled separately).

Key patterns that need fixing:

1. __builtin_unreachable() / __builtin_trap() not recognized as noreturn in sema
   - is_noreturn_call() only checks the function table, not builtin names
   - Fix: Also check if the callee name is __builtin_unreachable or __builtin_trap

2. do-while(0) body divergence not checked
   - do { noreturn_call(); } while(0) falls through in current analysis
   - Fix: Check if the body diverges, not just if the condition is constant-true

3. Constant expression evaluation too limited
   - while(true) not detected because 'true' is an enum constant, not an int literal
   - if(!(0)) not recognized as constant-true
   - Fix: Handle enum constants, logical-not, casts in is_constant_true_expr()

4. Local extern declaration noreturn attribute not propagated
   - BUILD_BUG() expands to a local extern noreturn function declaration
   - parse_local_declaration() doesn't propagate noreturn to function info
   - Fix: Propagate noreturn from local extern declarations to FunctionInfo

These patterns appear in:
- hugetlb.h: BUILD_BUG() as only statement
- swapops.h: BUILD_BUG() as only statement
- xz_dec_stream.c: while(true) { switch { ... } } not seen as infinite loop
- zstd_decompress.c: similar patterns
- workqueue.c: similar patterns
- interval_tree.c: similar patterns
