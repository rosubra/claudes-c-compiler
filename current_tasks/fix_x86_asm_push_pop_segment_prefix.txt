Fix x86 assembler: segment prefix, cross-section relocations, ALU symbol relocation offsets, section stack.

Four related fixes for x86 standalone assembler kernel build:

1. Add segment override prefix (gs:/fs:) to push/pop/mov-imm-mem encoding by calling
   emit_segment_prefix() in encode_push, encode_pop, and encode_mov_imm_mem.

2. Fix cross-section relocation resolution: resolve_internal_relocations() was resolving
   R_X86_64_32 relocations for local labels across different sections (e.g., .pushsection
   .discard.noendbr / .long .Lhere / .popsection). Added target_sec == sec_idx check so
   cross-section references are kept as relocations for the linker.

3. Fix ALU immediate symbol relocation offset doubling: encode_alu's cmpq $symbol, mem/reg
   paths used inline Relocation creation with self.bytes.len() + self.offset, but the caller
   in elf_writer_common.rs adds base_offset (== section_data_len == self.offset) again,
   doubling the section offset. Fixed by using add_relocation() which cancels self.offset.

4. Fix section stack to save/restore both current_section and previous_section during
   .pushsection/.popsection, matching the ARM/RISC-V writer_base.rs behavior.
