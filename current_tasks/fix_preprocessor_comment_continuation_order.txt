Task: Fix preprocessor translation phase ordering (line splicing before comment stripping)

Problem:
Multi-line block comments inside #define macro definitions with \ line continuations
caused the macro body to be truncated. This was because strip_block_comments() was
called before join_continued_lines(), violating C11 5.1.1.2 translation phase ordering.

The block comment stripping preserved newlines within comments for line numbering,
which then broke the \ continuation chains when join_continued_lines ran second.

Fix:
Swap the order: join_continued_lines() first (phase 2), then strip_block_comments() (phase 3).

Impact:
This fixes mbedtls library build (psa_crypto.c was failing with duplicate assembly labels
because LOCAL_OUTPUT_FREE macro body was being truncated).
