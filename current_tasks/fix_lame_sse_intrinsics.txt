Fix missing SSE1 float-domain intrinsics in xmmintrin.h that cause lame to fail on x86.

Missing intrinsics needed by lame:
- _mm_set_ps1 (alias for _mm_set1_ps)
- _mm_and_ps (bitwise AND on float vectors)
- _mm_xor_ps (bitwise XOR on float vectors)
- _mm_sqrt_ps (packed square root)

Also adding commonly-used SSE1 intrinsics for completeness:
- _mm_or_ps (bitwise OR)
- _mm_andnot_ps (bitwise AND-NOT)
- _mm_sqrt_ss (scalar square root)
- _mm_rcp_ps / _mm_rcp_ss (reciprocal approximation)
- _mm_rsqrt_ps / _mm_rsqrt_ss (reciprocal square root approximation)
- _mm_cmpgt_ps, _mm_cmplt_ps, _mm_cmpeq_ps, etc. (comparison intrinsics)

Also fixing check_x86.sh build script to match the manual build pattern
used by other architectures (since autotools configure is unreliable).

Status: in_progress
