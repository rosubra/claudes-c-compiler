Task: Fix __attribute__ after pointer in declarators and enum-in-struct with qualifiers

Two parser/sema fixes:

1. __attribute__ after pointer `*` in declarators:
   Currently `int * __attribute__((noinline)) foo(...)` fails to parse because
   skip_gcc_extensions() is called before the pointer loop but not after each pointer.
   Fix: add skip_gcc_extensions() call after skip_cv_qualifiers() in the pointer loop.

2. Enum constants not registered when struct field has qualifiers/array dims:
   `enum { A, B } volatile field[2];` inside a struct fails to register enum constants
   A and B at file scope. The issue is in parse_struct_fields or type resolution when
   qualifiers appear between the enum type and the field name.

Impact: ~200 test fixes across multiple suites.
