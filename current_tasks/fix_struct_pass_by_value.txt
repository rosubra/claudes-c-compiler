Task: Fix struct/union pass-by-value in function calls
Status: In Progress

Problem:
When a struct is passed by value to a function (e.g., foo(struct TAG st)),
the compiler currently passes a pointer to the caller's struct without
making a copy. The callee treats the parameter as a raw pointer, not as
a local copy of the struct. This causes segfaults and wrong behavior because:
1. The callee's alloca is only 8 bytes (pointer-sized) instead of struct-sized
2. The callee has no struct_layout info for the parameter
3. Member access on struct parameters fails

Fix approach:
- At function entry: allocate full struct size for struct params, emit Memcpy
  from the passed-in pointer to the local alloca, and track proper struct layout
- Add Memcpy IR instruction for block memory copies
- Implement Memcpy in all three backend codegens (x86, ARM, RISC-V)
- Store function parameter type info (struct layouts) to support this

Files to modify:
- src/ir/ir.rs - Add Memcpy instruction
- src/ir/lowering/lowering.rs - Fix struct param lowering
- src/backend/codegen_shared.rs - Add emit_memcpy trait method and dispatch
- src/backend/x86/codegen/codegen.rs - Implement memcpy
- src/backend/arm/codegen/codegen.rs - Implement memcpy
- src/backend/riscv/codegen/codegen.rs - Implement memcpy
