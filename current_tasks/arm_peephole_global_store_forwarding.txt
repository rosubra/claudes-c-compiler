Task: Add global store forwarding and copy propagation to ARM peephole optimizer
Status: in_progress

Description:
The ARM (AArch64) peephole optimizer currently only has local passes (adjacent
store/load elimination, self-move elimination, move chain optimization, branch
fusion). The x86 peephole has several global passes that dramatically reduce
code size and improve runtime performance.

This task ports the most impactful global passes to the ARM peephole:

1. Global store forwarding: Track slot->register mappings across basic blocks.
   When a load targets a slot that already has a known register value, replace
   the load with a register move. This eliminates hundreds of redundant loads.

2. Register copy propagation: After store forwarding converts stack loads to
   register moves, propagate these copies into subsequent instructions.

3. Dead store elimination (global): Remove stores to stack slots that are
   never loaded in the entire function.
