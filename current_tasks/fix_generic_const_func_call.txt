Fix _Generic const-qualified type matching and function call lowering

Problem: _Generic selection expressions had two bugs:
1. Const-qualified pointer types (e.g., `const int *` vs `int *`) were not distinguished
   because CType doesn't track const/volatile qualifiers. The first matching association
   always won, regardless of const qualification.
2. When _Generic selected a function name (not a function pointer variable), the compiler
   generated an indirect call that dereferenced the function address (reading code bytes
   as a pointer value) instead of calling the function directly.

These bugs caused the Linux kernel's dev_fwnode() macro to crash: it uses _Generic to
dispatch between const and non-const versions, and the selected function was called
through a garbage pointer.

Fix:
1. Track const qualification in GenericAssociation.is_const, ParamDecl.is_const, and
   LocalInfo.is_const. Use const-aware matching in resolve_generic_selection only when
   associations differ by const-ness.
2. Resolve GenericSelection expressions in lower_function_call before dispatching to
   emit_call_instruction, so function identifiers selected by _Generic take the direct
   call path.
