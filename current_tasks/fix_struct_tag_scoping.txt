Fix struct tag scoping in type_spec_to_ctype path

Bug: When two functions each define a local struct with the same tag name
(e.g., `struct tagx`) but different members, the second definition overwrites
the first globally. This is because the `struct_or_union_to_ctype` path in
`types.rs` uses `insert_struct_layout_from_ref` (unscoped) instead of
`insert_struct_layout_scoped`.

The `register_struct_type` path in `structs.rs` correctly uses scoped insertion,
but the `type_spec_to_ctype` -> `struct_or_union_to_ctype` path bypasses scoping.

Fix: Add `insert_struct_layout_scoped_from_ref` to TypeContext that uses interior
mutability (like the existing `from_ref` methods) but also tracks the scope frame.
Then use it in `struct_or_union_to_ctype`.

Affected tests: compiler_suite_0048_0099 and likely others with local struct tag reuse.
