Task: Fix self-referential global struct initializers emitting zero instead of address

Bug: When a global struct variable references itself in its initializer
(e.g., `struct Node n = {10, &n};`), the pointer field is emitted as zero
bytes instead of a relocation to the variable's own address. Non-self-referential
address initializers work correctly.

This causes SIGSEGV at runtime when the self-referencing pointer is dereferenced.
Affects multiple compiler_suite tests (0010_0047, 0048_0047, 0053_0215, etc.)
and potentially real-world code using self-referential linked lists/trees.

Plan:
1. Find the global initializer emission code
2. Identify why self-references produce zero
3. Fix to emit proper relocations for self-referential addresses
4. Add regression test

Status: IN PROGRESS
