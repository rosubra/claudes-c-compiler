Rewriting the x86 assembler README (src/backend/x86/assembler/README.md).

The current README has many inaccuracies:
- Incorrect line counts (encoder.rs nearly double claimed size)
- Wrong types for Byte/Short variants (Vec<u8>/Vec<i16> vs actual Vec<DataValue>)
- Missing AsmItem variants (PushSection, PopSection, Org, SkipExpr)
- Missing directives (.pushsection, .popsection, .rept, .balign, .org, .string)
- Undocumented AVX, BMI2, SSE4.1 instruction support
- Claims "no expression evaluation" when full recursive-descent evaluator exists
- Missing features: numeric labels, C-style comments, suffix inference
- Missing relocation types (GOT32, TPOFF64, PC8_INTERNAL)

Will rewrite to be accurate and complete.
