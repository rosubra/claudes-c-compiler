Task: Fix hardcoded I64 widening in IR lowering for i686
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-28

Description:
On 64-bit targets, all integer operations in IR lowering are widened to I64
(the machine word size). On i686 (32-bit ILP32), I32 operations should stay
I32 and only genuine I64 (long long) operations should use I64.

This patch introduces widened_op_type() in common/types.rs and replaces
hardcoded IrType::I64 references in expr_ops.rs and expr_assign.rs with
target-aware calls. This allows the i686 backend to handle native 32-bit
operations without unnecessary 64-bit register pair gymnastics.

Files modified:
- src/common/types.rs: Added widened_op_type() helper
- src/ir/lowering/expr_ops.rs: Use widened_op_type for binop/unary widening
- src/ir/lowering/expr_assign.rs: Use widened_op_type for assignment widening
- src/ir/lowering/expr.rs: Fix maybe_narrow to use widened_op_type
- src/ir/lowering/expr_calls.rs: Fix maybe_narrow_call_result to use widened_op_type
