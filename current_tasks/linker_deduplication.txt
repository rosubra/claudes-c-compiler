Refactoring linker code to extract shared infrastructure from all 4 backends.

The linkers for x86, i686, ARM, and RISC-V duplicate ~88% of their code (section merging,
file loading, symbol resolution, argument parsing, ELF header/section emission).

Plan:
1. Extract shared functions into linker_common.rs (load_file, load_archive, merge_sections,
   register_symbols, allocate_common_symbols, argument parsing)
2. Migrate each backend to use the shared infrastructure
3. Focus on 64-bit backends first (x86, ARM, RISC-V), then i686 where possible
