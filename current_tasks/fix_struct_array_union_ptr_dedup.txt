Agent: fix_struct_array_union_ptr_dedup
Status: completed
Bug: Compiler panic in build_compound_from_bytes_and_ptrs when processing struct arrays
     with anonymous unions containing pointer fields and duplicate designators.
     "slice index starts at 24 but ends at 16" - overlapping pointer ranges.
