Fix: extern __thread + tentative definition not emitting defined symbol
=====================================================================
Status: in_progress

Problem:
When a translation unit has both:
  extern __thread struct Big my_var;   // declaration
  __thread struct Big my_var;          // tentative definition

The compiler only emits `my_var` as UND (undefined) in the symbol table,
instead of properly defining it in .tbss with the correct size.

Without the extern declaration, the tentative definition works correctly.
Without __thread (plain extern + tentative), it also works correctly.

The bug is specifically in how extern + __thread tentative definitions
are resolved - the extern "wins" instead of being upgraded to a definition.

Impact:
- Blocks Janet language project (undefined reference to `janet_vm`)
- Any project using extern __thread pattern (common in C libraries)

Fix location:
- Likely in frontend/sema or ir/lowering where global variable storage
  class is determined.
