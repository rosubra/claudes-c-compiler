Fix parallel build race condition and improve pp-number suffix detection

1. Assembly file race condition in parallel builds:
   - When multiple compiler instances target the same output path in parallel
     (e.g., multiple Makefile targets compile the same .c file), they race on
     the intermediate .s file (written as `output.o.s`).
   - Fix: Use unique temp files with PID and atomic counter in the filename.
   - This fixes mbedtls test program builds which have parallel make targets.

2. Improved pp-number suffix detection (enhances fix_ppnumber_suffix_macro_expansion):
   - The upstream fix checks chars[start-1] (original input text) which doesn't
     account for macro expansions that change the output context.
   - My fix checks result.as_bytes() (actual output so far) which correctly handles
     cases like FOO(1).BAR(2) where FOO expands to "1 " - the trailing space means
     the dot after FOO's expansion is NOT part of a pp-number.
   - Also fixes the "base+GETARG" false positive by requiring the e/p before +/- to
     be preceded by a hex digit (not just any character).

Status: In progress
