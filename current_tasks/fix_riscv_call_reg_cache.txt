Task: Fix stale accumulator register cache in emit_call phase transitions

The emit_call method in traits.rs runs multiple phases that load values into
the accumulator register (t0 on RISC-V). Between phases, the register cache
was not invalidated, causing Phase 3 (emit_call_reg_args) to skip reloading
t0 when it believed it already held a value from Phase 2 (emit_call_stack_args).

This caused riscv-long-double-stack-params to fail: when Phase 2 spills a
long double to the stack using t0 as a scratch register, the cache falsely
reports t0 still holds a prior value, causing Phase 3 to pass stale data.

Fix: Add reg_cache.invalidate_acc() calls between phases 1->2 and 2->3.
