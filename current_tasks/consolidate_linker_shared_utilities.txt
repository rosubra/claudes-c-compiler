Task: Consolidate shared linker utilities into linker_common.rs

The four backend linkers duplicate several utility functions and patterns.
This task consolidates them into linker_common.rs:

1. Move ELF writing helpers (write_shdr, write_phdr, write_phdr_at, align_up, pad_to)
   from riscv/linker/relocations.rs into linker_common.rs
   and have all backends use the shared versions
2. Create shared parse_linker_args() function to replace duplicated argument parsing
3. Create shared check_undefined_symbols() function for ELF64 backends
4. Have RISC-V linker use shared functions from linker_common where possible
5. Clean up dead code in linker_common (activate load_file_elf64)

Note: ARM linker dedup is being handled by cleanup_arm_linker_dedup task.
This focuses on RISC-V + x86 + shared infrastructure.
