Optimize compile pipeline: reduce allocations and redundant computation

Profiling shows 17.5% of compile time in malloc/free/realloc and 5% in memcpy.
Several specific optimizations targeted:

1. Eliminate preprocessed.clone() in compile_to_assembly (driver.rs line 1240)
   - Currently clones entire preprocessed output string to pass to add_file
   - Fix: pass ownership, reference stored content for subsequent operations

2. Eliminate duplicate compute_line_offsets call
   - add_file() computes line offsets for the preprocessed output
   - build_line_map() recomputes the same line offsets on the same data
   - Fix: reuse the line offsets already computed in add_file

3. Optimize compute_line_offsets with memchr
   - Currently iterates byte-by-byte to find newlines
   - memchr crate or manual optimization can find newlines faster

4. Eliminate unnecessary .to_string() in lexer lex_decimal_number
   - Line 347 does from_utf8().to_string() just to parse the number
   - The &str borrow from from_utf8 is sufficient for parsing

5. Reduce from_utf8 overhead in lexer identifier scanning
   - Use faster byte-to-str conversion for known-ASCII content
