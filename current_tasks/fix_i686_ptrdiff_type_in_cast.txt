Fix: get_binop_type returns wrong type for pointer subtraction on i686

Bug: get_binop_type() in expr_types.rs has no special case for pointer subtraction (ptr - ptr).
It falls through to the generic wider_type computation, which propagates operand types (e.g. U64
from pointer+offset arithmetic) instead of returning ptrdiff_t (I32 on i686).

This causes Cast instructions like (u64)(ptr - ptr) to have from_ty: U64 instead of from_ty: I32,
making the cast a noop instead of a widening. The upper 32 bits of the result are then uninitialized.

Impact: xdelta i686 string_matching test fails because match_length gets garbage in upper 32 bits.

Fix: Add pointer subtraction check to get_binop_type, mirroring the existing logic in get_binop_ctype.

Status: in_progress
