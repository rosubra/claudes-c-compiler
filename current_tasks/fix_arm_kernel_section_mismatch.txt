Task: Fix ARM kernel section mismatch in idle_init -> fork_idle

Problem: ARM kernel build fails with modpost section mismatch error:
  idle_init+0xd0 (.text) -> fork_idle (.init.text)

Root cause: The always_inline budget enforcement (MAX_ALWAYS_INLINE_BUDGET_PER_CALLER=100)
skips always_inline callees when the budget is exhausted, even when the caller has a section
attribute (e.g., .init.text). This causes idle_init (always_inline) to not be inlined into
idle_threads_init (.init.text), leaving a standalone .text function that references
fork_idle (.init.text), triggering the section mismatch.

Fix: When the caller has a section attribute, bypass the always_inline budget check.
Section mismatch is a hard build failure; stack overflow from large frames is a runtime
issue that can be addressed separately.
