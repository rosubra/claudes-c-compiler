Fix hostapd x86 build: x86 linker group resolution for direct .a archives

The x86 linker loaded direct .a files (passed as bare paths in user_args) in a single
pass outside the group resolution loop. This meant circular dependencies between
directly-passed archives (e.g., libcrypto.a <-> libtls.a with -Wl,--start-group) were
not resolved. Fix: separate .a files from .o files in extra_object_files and include
the .a files in the iterative group resolution loop alongside -l libraries.
