Fix i686 inline asm "g" constraint register conflict

Problem:
When all 6 i686 GP registers are consumed by specific inline assembly constraints
(e.g., "a", "b", "c", "d", "S", "D"), the "g" constraint falls back to returning
"eax" which conflicts with the "a" constraint. This causes the syscall number to be
overwritten by the 6th argument value.

This affects __syscall6 in musl, causing mmap2 to execute as restart_syscall (syscall 0),
which makes malloc fail, which cascades to break io and environ tests.

Fix:
When no GP registers are available for a "g" constraint, fall back to a memory operand
(stack slot) instead of returning a conflicting register.

Status: in_progress
