Task: Refactor types.rs - consolidate duplicated type resolution and split into modules
Status: In progress

Problem:
types.rs is 2747 lines with three major functions (get_expr_type, sizeof_expr, get_expr_ctype)
that all traverse the same AST with nearly identical match structures but return slightly
different results. This creates ~750 lines of parallel code that can diverge, is hard to
maintain, and is a major source of spaghetti.

Additionally, eval_const_binop has heavily repeated is_32bit/is_unsigned branching patterns
that should be consolidated with a table-driven or closure-based approach.

Plan:
1. Create unified ExprTypeInfo resolution that computes all needed type info in one pass
2. Have get_expr_type, sizeof_expr, get_expr_ctype all delegate to the unified resolver
3. Factor out eval_const_binop arithmetic patterns
4. Split types.rs into:
   - types.rs (core CType/IrType conversion utilities)
   - const_eval.rs (compile-time constant expression evaluation)
   - expr_types.rs (expression type resolution)
   - builtins.rs (builtin typedefs and function seeds, if not already separate)
