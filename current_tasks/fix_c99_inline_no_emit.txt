Task: Fix C99 inline function emission - don't emit bodies for plain inline definitions
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Problem:
In C99, a plain `inline` function definition (without `extern` or `static`) does not
provide an external definition. The compiler should NOT emit a function body for such
definitions. The standalone definition should only come from the TU that uses
`extern inline`.

Currently, the compiler emits each C99 inline function as a static weak symbol in every
translation unit that includes it. This creates multiple copies with different addresses,
causing test failures in projects like mpack where function pointer address comparisons
are used (e.g., fn_mpack_tag_nil == &mpack_tag_nil).

Fix: In the lowering pass, mark C99 inline definitions (plain inline, no extern, no
static, no gnu_inline, and no non-inline declaration in the same TU) as skippable so
they are not emitted. The call sites should reference the external symbol, which will
be resolved to the extern inline definition from another TU.

Affects: mpack (all 4 architectures) and potentially other projects using C99 inline
functions across multiple translation units.
