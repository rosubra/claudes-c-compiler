Fix mruby build scripts to not require ruby/rake.

The mruby check scripts (check_i686.sh, check_riscv.sh, check_x86.sh, check_arm.sh)
currently depend on ruby/rake to build mruby, but these packages cannot be installed
in environments without network access.

The fix replaces the rake-based build with a direct C compilation approach using a
shared build_mruby.sh script that compiles all mruby source files and generated files
from the pre-built build directory.

This is a build script fix, not a compiler fix.
