Implement -shared (shared library) linking in the x86-64 built-in linker.
This is needed for PostgreSQL (which builds .so plugins for conversion procs)
and many other real-world projects.

Building on the existing task lock (add_shared_library_linking_x86.txt),
this implements the actual ET_DYN output support.
