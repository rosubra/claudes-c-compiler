Fix union global/local initialization when first member is a zero-width bitfield.

Bug: When a union has `unsigned long :0` as its first member followed by
actual data members (struct, array, etc.), the initializer is incorrectly
assigned to the zero-width bitfield instead of the first named member.

Root cause: In `for_union()` (types.rs), zero-width bitfields get
`bit_width = None`, making them indistinguishable from anonymous
struct/union members. The `resolve_init_field()` function then fails to
skip them during positional initialization.

Fix: Store `bit_width = Some(0)` (and `bit_offset = Some(0)`) for
zero-width bitfields in union layouts, matching their actual semantics.
This allows `resolve_init_field` to correctly skip them.
