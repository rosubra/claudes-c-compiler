Fix long double literal precision (completed)

Problem: Long double literals are parsed as f64, losing precision.
The 80-bit x87 extended format has a 64-bit mantissa (vs 52-bit for f64),
so values like 922337203685477580.7L lose their low bits.

Plan:
1. Change IrConst::LongDouble(f64) to LongDouble(f64, [u8; 16]) to store raw bytes
2. Implement decimal-string-to-x87-80bit conversion in pure Rust
3. Update lexer to compute full-precision bytes for long double literals
4. Update data emission to use raw bytes instead of converting f64 at emit time
5. Fix hex float L suffix bug (currently produces FloatLiteral instead of FloatLiteralLongDouble)

This fixes compiler_suite_0093_0050, compiler_suite_0137_0506, and potentially others.
