Task: Fix C99 inline linkage when non-inline declaration exists
Status: in_progress
Description: When a function is declared inline in its definition but has a
non-inline declaration in the same TU (e.g., from a header), C99 6.7.4p7 says
it provides an external definition. Currently our compiler treats ALL plain
inline functions as inline-only definitions (static+weak), causing link failures
when the function is called from other TUs (e.g., jq's tsd_dtoa_context_get).

Fix: During the lowerer's first pass, track which functions have at least one
non-inline file-scope declaration. In func_lowering, if the function has such
a declaration, set is_c99_inline_def=false so it gets normal global linkage.

This fixes jq build failures on all architectures.
