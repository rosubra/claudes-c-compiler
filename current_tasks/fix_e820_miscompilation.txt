Task: Fix miscompilation of arch/x86/kernel/e820.c causing kernel boot failure

Status: in_progress

Problem: When arch/x86/kernel/e820.c is compiled with CCC instead of GCC and swapped
into the kernel, the kernel fails to boot. This is the e820 memory map handling code
which is critical for early x86 boot.

Plan:
1. Compare CCC vs GCC assembly output for e820.c
2. Identify which function(s) are miscompiled
3. Create a minimal test case reproducing the bug
4. Fix the compiler bug
5. Verify the fix with --test-one-file
6. Add regression test
