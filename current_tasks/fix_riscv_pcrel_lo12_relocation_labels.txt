Task: Fix RISC-V PCREL_LO12 relocations using duplicate .L0 label

Problem: The RISC-V assembler emits all R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I and R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_S
relocations pointing to the same .L0 label. In RISC-V, each PCREL_HI20/PCREL_LO12 pair
must have a UNIQUE local label connecting the auipc (HI20) to the corresponding
addi/ld/sd (LO12). When multiple global/static variable accesses occur in one function,
all LO12 relocations incorrectly resolve to the first HI20's value.

Impact: This causes defconfig RISC-V kernel to crash during early boot because
pcpu_build_alloc_info and other functions compute wrong addresses for global variables.
The tinyconfig kernel works because smaller code rarely has multiple PCREL pairs in
one function.

Fix: Generate unique labels (.Lpcrel_hi0, .Lpcrel_hi1, etc.) for each PCREL_HI20
relocation, and have the corresponding PCREL_LO12 reference the correct unique label.

Status: in_progress
