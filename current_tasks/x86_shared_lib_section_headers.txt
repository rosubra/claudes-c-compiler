Add section headers to x86 shared library output (.so files).
The current emit_shared_library() sets e_shoff=0 and e_shnum=0,
which causes our own linker to fail when trying to consume these
.so files (parse_shared_library_symbols requires section headers
to find .dynsym/.dynstr). This breaks PostgreSQL which links
shared libraries against each other.

Fix: Add section header table to emit_shared_library() with
entries for .gnu.hash, .dynsym, .dynstr, .rela.dyn, .dynamic,
.got, merged sections, and .shstrtab.
