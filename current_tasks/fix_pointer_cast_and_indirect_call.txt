Task: Fix pointer cast type loss in parser, Ptr type handling in codegen, and ARM indirect call clobbering

Fixes:
1. Parser: cast expressions like (int*)p dropped pointer stars, treating (int*)p as (int)(*p)
   - parse_cast_expr now wraps type in TypeSpecifier::Pointer for each * in abstract declarator
2. Codegen: emit_cast_instrs in all three backends didn't handle IrType::Ptr, causing
   incorrect narrowing casts (sxtw on ARM) that destroyed pointer values
   - All backends now treat Ptr as equivalent to U64 for casting purposes
3. ARM: indirect function calls via function pointers clobbered x0 (first arg register)
   - Function pointer now loaded into x17 before argument setup

Status: In Progress
