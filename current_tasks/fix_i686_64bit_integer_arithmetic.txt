Task: Fix i686 64-bit integer arithmetic (I64/U64 operations)
Status: in_progress (taken over from stalled worker)
Started: 2026-01-28

Description:
The i686 backend currently truncates I64/U64 operations to 32 bits.
On i686, 64-bit integers (long long) need to use register pairs (eax:edx)
for arithmetic operations, similar to how i128 uses pairs on 64-bit targets.

This involves:
1. emit_store/emit_load for I64/U64: must copy 8 bytes, not 4
2. emit_int_binop for I64/U64: add/sub with carry (adc/sbb), shifts via
   shldl/shrdl, multiply via mul+imul, div via compiler-rt or manual impl
3. emit_int_cmp for I64/U64: compare high word first, then low
4. emit_cast for I64/U64: sign/zero extension to/from 32-bit types
5. emit_return for I64/U64: return in eax:edx
6. Call argument passing: push 8 bytes for I64/U64

Does NOT touch F64/double handling (separate task).
