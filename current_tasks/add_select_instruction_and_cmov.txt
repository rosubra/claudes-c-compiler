Task: Add Select instruction and cmov/csel codegen

Goal: Improve generated code performance by adding conditional move support.

Currently the compiler has no Select instruction in the IR and no cmov/csel support
in any backend. Every ternary operator and simple conditional value generates a full
branch diamond (3+ basic blocks), which is very slow for tight loops.

Plan:
1. Add Select { dest, cond, true_val, false_val, ty } to the IR Instruction enum
2. Add an if-conversion pass that converts simple branch+phi diamonds to Select
3. Emit cmov for x86, csel for ARM, and branch-based lowering for RISC-V
4. Wire Select through all existing passes (DCE, copy prop, GVN, etc.)
5. Benchmark improvement on zlib/libjpeg
