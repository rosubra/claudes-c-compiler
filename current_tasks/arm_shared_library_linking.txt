Add shared library support to the AArch64 (ARM64) linker for PostgreSQL.

This includes:
1. Dynamic executable linking: PT_INTERP, PT_DYNAMIC, .dynamic, .dynsym/.dynstr, .gnu.hash, PLT/GOT
2. Shared library loading: parse .so files to resolve undefined symbols against dynamic libs
3. Shared library output: link_shared() to produce ET_DYN .so files
4. Wire up -shared flag for ARM in common.rs

PostgreSQL requires shared library support because it builds .so plugins
(e.g., conversion procs, PL/pgSQL) and dynamically links against system libs.
