Task: Fix patchable function entries for inline functions
Status: In Progress

Problem:
The compiler emits __patchable_function_entries section records for ALL defined
functions, including static inline functions from headers. Since our compiler
doesn't inline static inline functions yet (it emits them as regular function
bodies), each kernel .o file gets ~1400 patchable function entries instead of
~5. This overwhelms the kernel's ftrace initialization at boot, causing boot
hangs/timeouts.

Fix:
Add an is_inline flag to IrFunction and skip emitting __patchable_function_entries
for inline functions. The kernel only needs patchable entries for non-inline
functions that are actually part of the module's external interface.

Files to modify:
- src/ir/ir.rs - Add is_inline to IrFunction
- src/ir/lowering/lowering.rs - Propagate is_inline from AST to IR
- src/backend/generation.rs - Skip patchable entries for inline functions
