Task: Fix segment override symbol codegen for x86 and i686 backends
Status: in_progress
Date: 2026-01-30

Problem:
The Linux kernel uses %gs: and %fs: segment override prefixes extensively for
per-CPU data. The x86 backend has emit_seg_load_symbol_impl and
emit_seg_store_symbol_impl methods in memory.rs, but these are never wired to
the ArchCodegen trait. Additionally, emit_seg_load and emit_seg_store also lack
trait delegation on x86. The i686 backend has emit_seg_load and emit_seg_store
but is missing emit_seg_load_symbol and emit_seg_store_symbol entirely.

This causes panics ("segment override loads only supported on x86") when
building the kernel with either USE_MY_32=0 or USE_MY_32=1, since the global
symbol path triggers the missing trait overrides.

Fix:
1. Wire all 4 segment override methods (emit_seg_load, emit_seg_store,
   emit_seg_load_symbol, emit_seg_store_symbol) to _impl functions in x86
   ArchCodegen trait impl.
2. Add emit_seg_load_symbol and emit_seg_store_symbol implementations to i686
   backend (using 32-bit addressing without %rip-relative).
3. Add regression test.
