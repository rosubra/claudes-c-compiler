Fix DTS preprocessing for RISC-V kernel build

Two bugs preventing RISC-V (and ARM) kernel build from completing:

1. preprocess_assembly() does not forward -x assembler-with-cpp to GCC,
   so GCC doesn't know how to handle .dts files and silently skips them.

2. -undef (standalone GCC flag) is incorrectly parsed as -U ndef due to
   the -U prefix match. Should be recognized as its own flag and forwarded
   to GCC when preprocessing assembly.

Status: in_progress
