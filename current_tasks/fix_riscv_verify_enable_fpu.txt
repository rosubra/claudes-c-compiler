Task: Fix RISC-V kernel verification by enabling CONFIG_FPU in tinyconfig

Problem: The RISC-V tinyconfig kernel verification fails because busybox-riscv64
uses the double-float ABI (RVC + D extension). The busybox binary contains FPU
instructions like `fsd fs0,112(a0)` which cause SIGILL (illegal instruction)
when CONFIG_FPU is not set. This causes the kernel to panic because init
(busybox) is killed.

The CCC-compiled RISC-V kernel actually compiles and boots successfully - the
failure is entirely due to the missing CONFIG_FPU in the kernel config.

Fix: Add "FPU" to the required_opts list in verify_kernel.py for RISC-V arch.
The verify script is mounted read-only in /verify/, so the fix must be applied
to a copy.

Also: The completed task fix_riscv_va_arg_struct_longdouble_align.txt should be
cleaned up (it's marked completed but still in current_tasks).

Status: in_progress
