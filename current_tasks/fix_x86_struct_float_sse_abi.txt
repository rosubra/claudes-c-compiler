Task: Fix x86-64 SysV ABI struct classification for SSE-class structs
Status: IN PROGRESS

Problem:
The x86-64 backend always passes struct arguments in GP registers (rdi, rsi, etc.),
never in SSE/xmm registers. This violates the SysV AMD64 ABI which requires:
- Each 8-byte "eightbyte" of a struct is independently classified as INTEGER or SSE
- If an eightbyte contains only float/double fields, it gets SSE class -> xmm register
- A struct {float, float} should be passed in xmm0, not rdi

This causes test failures when a struct-of-floats is passed to a function that expects
float _Complex (via #pragma weak alias), since float _Complex uses xmm0 but the struct
gets passed in rdi.

Fix involves:
1. Carry struct field type info from IR lowering through to codegen
2. Add SysV ABI per-eightbyte classification logic
3. Add new CallArgClass variants for SSE-classified struct eightbytes
4. Update x86 codegen caller and callee sides to use xmm registers for SSE-class eightbytes
