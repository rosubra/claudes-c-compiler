Fix inline asm "+r" read-write constraint preload overwriting input value

The shared inline asm backend (inline_asm.rs) has a bug where preload_readwrite_output()
overwrites the register that was already correctly loaded by the synthetic input mechanism.

For asm volatile("mov %0,%%cr4": "+r" (val) : : "memory"):
1. The synthetic input correctly loads val into the assigned register (e.g., rcx)
2. Then preload_readwrite_output() overwrites rcx with data from the output temp alloca,
   which is UNINITIALIZED at that point
3. The inline asm then executes with garbage in the register

This causes the Linux kernel to crash on boot because native_write_cr4() writes garbage
to the CR4 register, corrupting page table settings and causing a triple fault.

Fix: Skip preload_readwrite_output for GpReg/FpReg outputs since the synthetic input
already loaded the correct value. Only Specific constraints that bypass the synthetic
input mechanism might need preloading (but those are already skipped per a previous fix).
