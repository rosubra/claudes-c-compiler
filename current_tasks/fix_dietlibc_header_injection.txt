Task: Fix dietlibc build failure caused by unconditional stdio.h header injection
Status: in_progress

Problem:
The preprocessor's inject_header_declarations() unconditionally injects
`typedef struct _IO_FILE FILE;` whenever stdio.h is included. This conflicts
with projects like dietlibc that provide their own stdio.h with a different
FILE typedef (`typedef struct __stdio_file FILE;`), causing "storage size
isn't known" errors.

Fix:
Split inject_header_declarations into two functions:
- inject_builtin_macros_for_header: always called (stdarg.h builtins, stdbool.h)
- inject_fallback_declarations_for_header: only called when no real header found
  (stdio.h FILE typedef, errno.h, complex.h function declarations)
