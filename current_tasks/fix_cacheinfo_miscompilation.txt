Task: Fix miscompilation of arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cacheinfo.c causing kernel boot failure

Problem: arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cacheinfo.c is miscompiled by ccc, causing the kernel
to fail to boot. This is reproducible when testing the single file swap.

Status: in_progress - investigating root cause by comparing ccc output with GCC output
