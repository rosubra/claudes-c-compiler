Fix musl build on i686 with MY_ASM=builtin and MY_LD=builtin

Problem: The i686 builtin assembler is missing several x87 FPU and other instructions
needed by musl's i386 assembly files (fenv.s, math/*.s, etc).

Missing instructions to add:
- fnstenv, fldenv (x87 environment save/restore)
- fistl (store integer from x87)
- sahf (store AH to flags)
- fucom, fucomp (unordered compare)
- fadd, fsub, fmul, fdiv (register-form x87 arithmetic)
- jecxz (jump if ECX zero)
- std, cld (set/clear direction flag)

Also need to verify linker works for the resulting musl build.

Status: in_progress
