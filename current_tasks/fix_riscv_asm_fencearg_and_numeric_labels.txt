Fix two bugs in the RISC-V builtin assembler (MY_ASM=builtin):

1. Fence arg parsing priority: Single-char variable names (i, o, r, w) are
   misclassified as FenceArg by the parser, causing "expected symbol" errors
   when instructions like "lla t0, i" reference global variables named i/o/r/w.
   Fix: Only classify operands as FenceArg when the instruction is "fence".

2. Numeric label references (1b/1f): GNU assembler numeric label back/forward
   references are not resolved. The parser treats "1b" as a symbol name instead
   of resolving it to the nearest "1:" label. Fix: Add numeric label resolution
   to the ELF writer.

These two fixes together should recover ~60 test failures when MY_ASM=builtin.
