Task: Implement C89 implicit int for declarations with storage class specifiers

Problem: Declarations like "static x = 5;" or "register y = 0;" are valid C89 where
the type defaults to int. Our parser does not handle this, causing the Doom project
(and other C89-era codebases) to fail to compile.

Fix: In parse_type_specifier(), track whether any storage class specifier (static,
extern, register, auto, typedef, _Thread_local) was consumed. If no base type
specifier was found but a storage class was consumed, default to int.

Status: in_progress
