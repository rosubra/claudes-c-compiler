Task: Fix i686 struct return ABI (small struct return via eax:edx)
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-28

Problem:
1. classify_struct_return() uses hardcoded x86-64 thresholds (8/16 bytes).
   On i686, structs > 8 bytes should use sret (hidden pointer), not two-register
   return, because eax:edx is only 8 bytes total.

2. Small struct return (1-8 bytes) is packed as I64 in the IR. On i686, the return
   path only puts the low 32 bits into eax via operand_to_eax(). Structs 5-8 bytes
   (like struct Point {int x, int y}) lose their upper half because edx is never set.

3. The caller side after a call also only saves eax (32 bits) via store_eax_to().
   The edx value containing the upper 32 bits of the struct is lost.

Fix:
1. Make classify_struct_return target-aware: on 32-bit targets, structs > 8 bytes
   use sret, and there is no two-register (I128) return path.
2. Override emit_return in i686 to load I64 values into eax:edx pair.
3. Override emit_call_store_result in i686 to save eax:edx for I64 returns.
