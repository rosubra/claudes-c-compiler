Task: Fix x86 kernel miscompilation in mm/page_alloc.c

The delta debugging tool identified that mm/page_alloc.c compiled with our
compiler causes an x86 boot failure (timeout - kernel hangs during boot).
Investigating the miscompilation to find and fix the underlying compiler bug.

Also fixing same_operand in simplify.rs to handle cross-width integer constants
in Select simplification (e.g., select cond, I32(0), I64(0) → 0).

Status: in_progress
