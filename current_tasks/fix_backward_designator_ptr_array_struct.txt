Fix backward designated initializers in pointer arrays within struct initializers

Bug: When a struct contains a pointer array initialized with designated
initializers where indices go backward (e.g., [3]=fn3, [1]=fn1), the
backward-jumping elements are placed at sequential positions instead of
at their designated indices.

Example:
  static const struct { int *ptrs[5]; } s = {
      .ptrs = { [0]=&v0, [3]=&v3, [1]=&v1 }
  };
  // CCC: ptrs[1] is NULL, ptrs[4] has &v1 (wrong!)
  // GCC: ptrs[1] has &v1, ptrs[4] is NULL (correct)

Root cause: The compound struct global init path that handles pointer arrays
doesn't properly reset the current element index when a designator jumps
backward. After processing [3]=fn3, the index counter is at 4, and when
[1]=fn1 comes, it stays at 4 instead of going back to 1.

This fixes the pkgconf project (provides version matching) and likely other
projects with similar patterns.

Status: in_progress
