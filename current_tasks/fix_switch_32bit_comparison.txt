Task: Fix switch statement comparisons to use correct register sizes for int values

Problem: Switch statements always use 64-bit comparisons (cmpq %rax) even when the
switch expression is a 32-bit int. This causes incorrect behavior when enum constants
have the high bit set (e.g., 0xE9918625), because:
- The caller zero-extends the constant to 64 bits: movabs $0xe9918625, %rax
- The switch's cmp sign-extends the immediate: cmpq $0xffffffffe9918625, %rsi
- These don't match, so the correct case is never taken.

GCC correctly uses cmpl with %esi/%eax for int-typed switch expressions.

Affected project: mozjpeg (uses large enum GUIDs like JINT_COMPRESS_PROFILE=0xE9918625)

Fix:
1. Add IrType field to Terminator::Switch in instruction.rs
2. Propagate type through emit_switch in traits.rs and generation.rs
3. Use cmpl/testl with 32-bit registers in x86 emit_switch_case_branch when type is I32/U32

Status: in_progress
