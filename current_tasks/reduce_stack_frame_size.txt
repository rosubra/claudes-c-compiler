Task: Reduce stack frame size by using type-appropriate slot sizes
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Goal: Fix postgres plpgsql recursion test failures caused by 3.8x larger
stack frames compared to GCC. Currently all SSA values get 8-byte slots
even for i32/i16/i8 types.

Approach: Use 4-byte slots for i32 and smaller types in stack frame
layout, and emit movl instead of movq for 32-bit values.
