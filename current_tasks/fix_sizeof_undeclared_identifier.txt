Task: Fix sizeof(undeclared_identifier) silently accepted by sema + fix cairo build scripts
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Problem:
- sema does not validate expressions inside sizeof/alignof, so sizeof(uint128_t)
  with an undeclared identifier is silently accepted.
- The lowering silently returns 4 (sizeof(int)) for unknown identifiers in sizeof.
- This causes meson to incorrectly detect uint128_t as available when building cairo,
  leading to compilation errors.
- Also fix cairo's missing cairo_test.c and libm_compat.c build script files.

Fix:
- Make sema recurse into sizeof/alignof expression arguments to validate them
- Make lowering emit an error for unknown identifiers in sizeof
