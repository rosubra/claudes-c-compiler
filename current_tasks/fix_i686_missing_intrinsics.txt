Task: Implement emit_intrinsic for i686 backend
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-28

Description:
The i686 backend is missing the emit_intrinsic() method entirely.
The trait provides a default empty implementation, so all intrinsic
operations (FabsF32, FabsF64, SqrtF32, SqrtF64, FrameAddress,
ReturnAddress, fences, SSE/SIMD operations) produce no code at all.

This causes widespread test failures where fabs(), sqrt(), and other
builtins silently return garbage values.

Fix: Implement emit_intrinsic in i686 codegen using x87 FPU instructions
for fabs/sqrt, and appropriate 32-bit instructions for other intrinsics.
