Task: Replace hash-based data structures with flat Vec lookups in optimization passes

Profile shows ~20% of compile time is malloc/free, much driven by FxHashSet/FxHashMap
in the optimization passes that run repeatedly (DCE, copy_prop, constant_fold).

Since IR Value IDs are dense sequential u32s, we can replace:
- DCE: FxHashSet<u32> -> Vec<bool> bitvector (O(1) set/check, no hashing)
- Copy propagation: FxHashMap<u32, Operand> -> Vec<Option<Operand>> (flat lookup table)
- Constant fold: Similar hash -> vec optimizations where applicable
- Add max_value_id() helper to IrFunction to avoid duplicated scanning code

This eliminates per-element allocation, hashing overhead, and probe chains.
Expected impact: measurable reduction in malloc/free pressure during -O2 compilation.
