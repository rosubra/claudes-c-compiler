Task: Fix bitfield packing in lower_struct_array_with_ptrs

Problem:
When a static/const struct array contains elements with both pointer fields AND
bitfield members, the lower_struct_array_with_ptrs function serializes initialization
data to a byte buffer. However, non-pointer bitfield fields are handled by the
generic write_const_to_bytes path, which writes the raw integer value at the byte
offset without applying bitfield bit-shift and mask packing.

This is a separate function from lower_struct_global_init_compound (which another
task covers for single structs). This function handles struct ARRAYS specifically.

Example:
  struct chunk_info {
      void (*handler)(void);
      unsigned int max_length :12;
      unsigned int min_length :8;
      unsigned int pos_before :4;
  };
  static const struct chunk_info chunks[] = {
      { handler_a, 13, 13, 1 },
  };

The handler pointer forces the compound array path, but bitfield members are
written as full-width values without bit shifting/masking.

Fix: In lower_struct_array_with_ptrs, check for bit_offset/bit_width on the
field layout and use write_bitfield_to_bytes instead of write_const_to_bytes
for bitfield members.

Impact: Fixes libpng IHDR chunk dispatch table runtime error where bitfield
values read as wrong values causing "IHDR: too long" errors.
