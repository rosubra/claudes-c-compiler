Task: Fix RISC-V variadic struct argument splitting across register/stack boundary
Status: in_progress
Description: On RISC-V, when a 2-register struct argument reaches the boundary
where only 1 GP register remains (e.g., a7), the first XLEN bytes should go into
that register and the rest should go on the stack. Currently our compiler puts the
entire struct on the stack, skipping the last register. This causes va_arg to read
shifted values, producing wrong output for struct {double, double} and similar types
in variadic functions.

Affects tests: 0081_0002, 0081_0003, 0172_0038, 0172_0039, 0048_0047
Root cause: call_abi.rs struct classification sends entire struct to stack when
int_idx + regs_needed > max_int_regs, but RISC-V psABI requires splitting.
