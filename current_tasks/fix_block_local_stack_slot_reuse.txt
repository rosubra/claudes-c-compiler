Task: Add within-block liveness-based stack slot reuse for Tier 3 block-local values

Problem: The Tier 3 block-local stack slot allocator uses a bump allocator that
never reuses slots within a block. Functions with heavily unrolled macros (like
blake2s_compress_generic with 10 ROUND() macro expansions) generate thousands
of SSA intermediates in a single basic block, each getting its own 8-byte stack
slot. This causes enormous stack frames (28KB for blake2s vs GCC's 0 bytes) that
overflow the kernel's limited stack (8-16KB), crashing during boot.

Fix: Implement within-block slot reuse based on liveness. For each block's
Tier 3 pool, compute the last-use instruction index for each value. When
allocating a new slot, check if any previously allocated slot's value is dead
(last use before current instruction). If so, reuse that slot instead of
bump-allocating a new one. This is a greedy interval coloring within each block.

Impact: Fixes kernel boot crash in lib/crypto/blake2s-generic.c and potentially
other files with heavily unrolled code.
