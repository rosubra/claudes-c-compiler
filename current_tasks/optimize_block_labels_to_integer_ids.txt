Task: Replace String-based block labels with integer BlockId(u32) in IR

Profiling shows lowering takes 51% of compile time on sqlite3.c. The #1 bottleneck is
heap-allocated String labels for basic blocks. Every block label is a format!()-allocated
String, cloned 2-5 times per control flow construct.

Plan:
1. Add BlockId(u32) type to ir.rs (Copy, no heap allocation)
2. Change Terminator branches to use BlockId instead of String
3. Change Phi incoming edges to use BlockId instead of String
4. Change BasicBlock to use BlockId (keep String label for asm emission)
5. Update lowering fresh_label() to return BlockId
6. Update all label references in lowering/ to use BlockId
7. Update mem2reg, phi_eliminate, optimization passes
8. Update codegen to format labels from BlockId
9. Verify no regressions on test suite

Expected impact: Eliminate thousands of String allocations per function,
potentially 30-40% reduction in lowering phase time.
