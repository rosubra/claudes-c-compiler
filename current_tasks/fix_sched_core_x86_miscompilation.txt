Task: Fix x86 kernel miscompilation in mm/page_alloc.c

The delta debugging tool identified that mm/page_alloc.c compiled with our
compiler causes a boot hang (223s timeout). The page allocator is one of the
kernel's most critical subsystems. Investigating the miscompilation to find
and fix the underlying compiler bug.

Note: kernel/sched/core.c was already fixed by recent stack_layout changes.
The original lock name was for sched/core.c but is now repurposed for page_alloc.c.

Status: in_progress
