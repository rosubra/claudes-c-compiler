Fix i686 64-bit builtin bit operations (clzll, ctzll, popcountll, etc.)

Problem:
The i686 backend's emit_int_clz, emit_int_ctz, and emit_int_popcount only
operate on 32-bit eax even when the IR type is I64/U64. This means
__builtin_clzll, __builtin_ctzll, __builtin_popcountll, __builtin_parityll,
__builtin_ffsll, and __builtin_clrsbll all produce wrong results for
runtime 64-bit values.

Fix:
Implement 64-bit versions by splitting the operation across the eax:edx
register pair. For example:
- clzll(x): if(edx != 0) lzcnt(edx) else 32 + lzcnt(eax)
- ctzll(x): if(eax != 0) tzcnt(eax) else 32 + tzcnt(edx)
- popcountll(x): popcnt(eax) + popcnt(edx)

Status: in_progress
