Fix cast-wrapped compound literals in static/global initializers

Bug: When a compound literal appears inside a cast in a global/static initializer,
e.g., .arr = (char *)(unsigned char[]) { 0xFD }, the pointer field resolves to NULL
instead of creating an anonymous global for the compound literal.

Root cause: resolve_ptr_field_init in global_init_compound.rs checks for bare
Expr::CompoundLiteral but doesn't unwrap Expr::Cast(_, CompoundLiteral, _).
The cast prevents the compound literal from being recognized.

Fix: Add Cast unwrapping in resolve_ptr_field_init so cast-wrapped compound
literals are handled the same as bare compound literals.

This fixes the libgrapheme project (and possibly others) on all architectures.

Status: in_progress
