Rewriting the parser README and fixing the lexer README.

Parser README issues to fix:
- "five files" should be "six files" for impl Parser blocks
- TypeSpecFlags field ordering doesn't match code
- Expr variant count says "over 30" but there are 43
- Identifier variant of Expr not mentioned
- Statement table omits Stmt::Expr
- Says "three expect variants" but there are four (omits expect_context)
- TypeSpecifier omits standalone Signed/Unsigned variants
- token_to_binop described as function not method
- Various minor issues

Lexer README issue:
- Claims bare typeof requires gnu_extensions but it's always recognized
