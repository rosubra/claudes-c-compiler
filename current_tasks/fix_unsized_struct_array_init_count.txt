Task: Fix unsized struct array initializer element count

Bug: compute_struct_array_init_count in const_eval.rs counts struct fields
by StructLayout::fields.len(), treating each field as consuming 1 flat
initializer item. But array-typed fields (e.g. I c[4]) consume N items.
This causes unsized struct arrays like:
  typedef struct{I c[4]; I b,e,k;} PT;
  PT cases[] = { val1,val2,val3,val4,val5,val6,val7, ... };
to compute the wrong element count (thinks 4 items = 1 struct, should be 7).

Fix: compute "flat scalar count" per struct that recursively accounts for
array fields and nested structs, then use that count for the comparison.

Status: IN PROGRESS
