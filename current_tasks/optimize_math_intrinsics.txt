Task: Optimize math library calls to inline instructions

Goal: Reduce execution time of compute-heavy tests that call pow/sqrt/fabs
by converting these library calls to inline instructions.

Key changes:
1. Add sqrt/fabs intrinsic ops to the IR
2. Lower __builtin_sqrt/__builtin_fabs to intrinsics instead of libc calls
3. Add IR simplification pass for math calls: pow(x,2)->x*x, sqrt->intrinsic, fabs->intrinsic
4. Emit sqrtsd/sqrtss on x86, fsqrt on ARM/RISC-V, inline fabs on all arches
5. This fixes ARM test timeouts where sqrt(pow(tmp,2)) in tight loops takes >5s via QEMU

Impact: Tests like compiler_suite_0041_0009 currently timeout on ARM (3.9s near 5s limit).
