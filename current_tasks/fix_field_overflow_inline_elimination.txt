Fix __field_overflow / __bad_mask undefined reference caused by dead branch elimination failure

Problem:
The Linux kernel uses __builtin_constant_p() guards around calls to external
error-reporting symbols like __field_overflow and __bad_mask. These symbols are
intentionally never defined; they exist solely to produce link-time errors when
a compile-time check fails. GCC and Clang eliminate the dead branches when the
guarding __builtin_constant_p() evaluates to false (or the constant condition
is satisfied), so the undefined references never reach the linker.

CCC is not properly eliminating these dead branches after inlining, causing
the undefined references to survive into the final link and produce
"undefined reference to __field_overflow / __bad_mask" linker errors.

Fix:
Ensure that CCC's optimization passes correctly evaluate __builtin_constant_p
after inlining and eliminate provably dead branches guarded by constant
predicates, so that calls to intentionally-undefined symbols are removed
before code generation.
