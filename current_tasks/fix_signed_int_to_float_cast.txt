Fix: SignedToFloat cast loses signedness for sub-64-bit integer sources

Bug: (double)(signed int)u where u is unsigned gives wrong result.
The cast chain (unsigned int -> signed int -> double) misses sign-extension
because:
1. Cast U32->I32 is classified as Noop (same size, bit pattern unchanged)
2. SignedToFloat codegen always uses 64-bit cvtsi2sd with rax
3. But the value in rax is zero-extended (not sign-extended) from 32 bits

Fix: Add from_ty to SignedToFloat CastKind and emit sign-extension
(movslq on x86) before 64-bit float conversion for sub-64-bit sources.

Affects all three architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V).
Fixes compiler_suite_0147_0069, llvm_unittest_2005_07_17_INT_To_FP, and others.
