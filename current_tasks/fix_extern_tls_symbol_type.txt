Task: Fix extern __thread symbol type in ELF output (mimalloc TLS mismatch)
Status: in_progress

Problem:
When a translation unit declares an extern __thread variable (e.g.,
`extern __thread mi_heap_t* _mi_heap_default;`) but doesn't actually use it
in code, the compiler emits `.hidden _mi_heap_default` but no `.type` directive.
The assembler creates a NOTYPE/HIDDEN undefined symbol. When the linker sees
this alongside the TLS definition from another TU (with STT_TLS in .tdata),
it fails with: "TLS definition in init.c.o section .tdata mismatches non-TLS
reference in libc.c.o"

Fix: For extern TLS globals, emit `.type sym, @tls_object` alongside the
visibility directive. This ensures the assembler creates a TLS-typed
undefined symbol that the linker can match correctly.

Projects that benefit: mimalloc (memory allocator) - has extern __thread
variables shared across multiple translation units.
