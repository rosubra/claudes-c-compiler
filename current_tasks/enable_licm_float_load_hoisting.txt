Enable LICM float/long-double load hoisting

The LICM pass (src/passes/licm.rs) has a conservative restriction that
prevents float, long-double, and i128 loads from being hoisted out of
loops. This was added when the backend register paths didn't support
these types, but they do now.

Task: Remove the type restriction at line ~753 so that float and
long-double loads (from non-address-taken allocas not modified in the
loop) are hoisted out of loops like integer loads are.

Also removing the i128 restriction since backends support it.
