Fix O(n^2) and expensive clone performance issues in IR lowering

The IR lowering phase is extremely slow for large files (25 seconds for ssl_tls.c
which has 2005 declarations and 355 functions). Profiling shows the lowering phase
accounts for 99%+ of compilation time.

Root causes identified:
1. O(n^2) global duplicate check: module.globals.iter().any(|g| g.name == name)
   is called for every global declaration, creating quadratic behavior.
2. Deep HashMap clones: self.locals.clone() is called on every compound statement
   scope entry, cloning LocalInfo structs that contain StructLayout, CType, Vec.
3. Struct layout recomputation: compute_struct_union_layout_packed is called
   repeatedly for the same inline struct definitions without caching.
4. Redundant format! allocations for struct layout HashMap keys.

Fixes:
- Add HashSet<String> for O(1) global name dedup check
- Replace locals.clone()/restore with a scope-stack (push new bindings, pop on exit)
- Cache struct layouts computed from inline definitions
- Reduce unnecessary allocations in hot paths

Status: In progress
