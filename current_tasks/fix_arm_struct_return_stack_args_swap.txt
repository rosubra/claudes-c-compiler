Fix ARM64 ABI bug: stack arguments swapped when function returns large struct.

When a function returns a struct larger than 16 bytes (requiring implicit x8 return pointer)
and has more than 8 explicit parameters (so some go on the stack), the stack-based
arguments are placed at the wrong offsets. This causes arguments 9 and 10 to be swapped.

Root cause: The caller-side codegen likely miscalculates the stack offset for arguments
when accounting for the implicit x8 return pointer, or puts stack args in reversed order.

Reproducer: zstd fullbench on ARM64 crashes with SIGSEGV because
ZSTD_buildSequencesStatistics (10 params, returns 32-byte struct) passes
entropyWorkspace and entropyWkspSize in the wrong order to HIST_countFast_wksp.
