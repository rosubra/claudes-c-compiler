Task: Fix long double support and struct array initialization
Status: COMPLETED

Changes made:

1. Long double literal support (lexer/parser/IR):
   - Added FloatLiteralLongDouble token variant to lexer
   - Added FloatLiteralLongDouble expression to AST
   - Added IrConst::LongDouble variant to IR
   - Long double globals stored as IEEE 754 double + 8 bytes padding (16 bytes total)
   - sizeof(long double) correctly returns 16
   - Long double arithmetic works at double precision via existing movsd codegen

2. Nested struct array initialization fix:
   - Fixed emit_struct_init to handle arrays of structs as struct fields
   - When an array field's element type is a struct, initializer lists for each
     element are now recursively processed via emit_struct_init
   - Flat initialization of struct arrays also works correctly
   - Added support for multi-dimensional array initialization within structs

3. Function pointer array declaration fix:
   - Parser now records array dimensions inside (*name[N])(params) declarators
     instead of discarding them via skip_array_dimensions
   - compute_decl_info recognizes FunctionPointer/Function derived declarators
     as indicating pointer-sized elements (8 bytes)
   - sizeof(int (*arr[N])(params)) now correctly returns N * 8
   - Calling through function pointer arrays works correctly

All existing tests pass with no regressions.
