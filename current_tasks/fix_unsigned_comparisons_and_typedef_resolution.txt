Task: Fix unsigned comparisons and typedef type resolution in IR lowering

Problem: Typedef'd unsigned types lose their signedness during IR lowering, causing
comparison operators to always use signed comparisons (Slt, Sle, Sgt, Sge) even when
operands are unsigned.

Example:
  typedef unsigned test_t;
  test_t a = (test_t)(-1);  // UINT_MAX = 4294967295
  test_t b = 0;
  printf("a > b: %d\n", a > b);  // Prints 0 (WRONG, should be 1)

Root causes:
1. TypedefName(_) always maps to IrType::I64 in type_spec_to_ir (types.rs:203)
   and CType::Int in type_spec_to_ctype (types.rs:624)
2. Comparison lowering always emits signed comparison ops (expr.rs:146-149)
3. Division/modulo always use SDiv/SRem, shift right always uses AShr
4. Typedef resolution map from sema is not passed to the Lowerer

Fix plan:
- Pass sema's typedef HashMap to Lowerer
- Resolve TypedefName in type_spec_to_ir and type_spec_to_ctype
- Check operand signedness for comparisons, div/mod, shift right
- Use Ult/Ule/Ugt/Uge for unsigned comparisons
- Use UDiv/URem for unsigned division
- Use LShr for unsigned shift right

Status: In progress
