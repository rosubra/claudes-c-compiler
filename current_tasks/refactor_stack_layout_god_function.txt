Task: Refactor calculate_stack_space_common god function

Status: in_progress

Goal: Break up the 822-line calculate_stack_space_common function in
src/backend/stack_layout.rs into smaller, well-named subfunctions.

The function has 9 clear logical phases that should each be their own
function:
1. Dead param alloca detection
2. Copy coalescing analysis
3. Copy alias propagation into use_blocks_map
4. Main slot collection loop (classify values into tiers)
5. Tier 3: Block-local greedy coloring
6. Tier 2: Liveness-based packing
7. Deferred slot assignment
8. Copy alias resolution
9. Wide value propagation through Copy chains

This is a pure refactor with zero functional changes.
