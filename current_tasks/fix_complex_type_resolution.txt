Fix complex number type resolution and conversion issues:

1. expr_ctype for Deref of array types (e.g., *array_of_complex)
   - Array types not handled in Deref case of expr_ctype, causing
     *array to return CType::Int instead of element type

2. get_function_return_ctype fallback to IrType
   - Functions returning non-complex scalars (e.g., long double) had
     their return CType resolved as Int, causing incorrect type
     conversions in complex assignment context

3. Scalar-to-complex return conversion
   - When a non-complex value is returned from a complex-returning
     function, need to implicitly convert scalar to complex type

4. lower_deref expr_ctype fallback
   - When get_expr_ctype returns None, fall back to expr_ctype to
     detect complex/struct/array pointer targets

Status: in progress
