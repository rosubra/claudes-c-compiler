Fix flat struct array initialization for local variables and global 2D arrays

Problem 1 - Local flat struct array init:
When a local array of structs is initialized with a flat (unbrace'd) list like:
  struct s { int a; int b; };
  struct s arr[3] = { 1,2,3,4,5,6 };
Only one value is stored per struct element (arr[0].a=1, arr[1].a=2, arr[2].a=3)
instead of filling fields sequentially (arr[0].a=1, arr[0].b=2, arr[1].a=3, etc.).

Root cause: In stmt.rs lines 379-436, the for loop processes one init item per
iteration and always stores to fields[0], advancing current_idx after each item.
It should instead call emit_struct_init() on the remaining items slice to properly
consume multiple items per struct element.

Problem 2 - Global 2D struct array flat init:
When a global 2D array of structs is initialized:
  struct s g[2][2] = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 };
or with partial braces:
  struct s g[2][2] = { {1,2,3,4}, {5,6,7,8} };
Only the first struct element per row is filled. The issue is that outer_stride
is the row stride (struct_size * inner_dim), so after fill_struct_global_bytes
fills one struct, current_idx advances by one outer_stride, skipping inner structs.

The fix needs to track struct elements within rows properly.

Status: In progress
