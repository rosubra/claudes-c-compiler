Fix VLA sizeof for typedef'd VLA types

Problem: sizeof(T) where T is a typedef for a VLA (e.g., typedef char buf[n][m])
returns a compile-time constant instead of computing the size at runtime.

Root cause: lower_sizeof only handles VLA sizeof for local variable names
(SizeofArg::Expr(Identifier)), not for type names (SizeofArg::Type).
When sizeof_type encounters a VLA dimension (non-constant expression), it
falls back to returning elem_size as if the dimension were 1.

Fix plan:
1. In lower_sizeof, add runtime VLA size computation for SizeofArg::Type
2. Create a helper that computes VLA type sizeof at runtime by walking
   the TypeSpecifier::Array chain and multiplying runtime dimensions
3. Test with the failing test case: typedef char buf[n][m]; sizeof(buf)

Affected tests: compiler_suite_0059_0008 (all three architectures)
