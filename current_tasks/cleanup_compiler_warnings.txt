Task: Clean up all 39 Rust compiler warnings
Status: in_progress
Description: The project currently emits 39 compiler warnings (dead code, unused
variables, unused methods/fields). For a project that should look clean to newcomers,
this needs to be fixed.

Categories of warnings:
- Unused variables (alloca_info, need_gp_check, jump_targets, was_uncond)
- Dead code: unused methods, functions, fields, enum variants across common/, frontend/,
  ir/, passes/, and backend/
- Multiple build target warning for main.rs

Approach: Remove or prefix with underscore as appropriate. Remove dead code that's
truly unused. Keep code that's part of a public API or will be needed soon with
appropriate allow attributes.
