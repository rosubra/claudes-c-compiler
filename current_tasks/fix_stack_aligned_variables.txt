Fix stack alignment for local variables with _Alignas / __attribute__((aligned(N)))

Local variables with _Alignas(N) or __attribute__((aligned(N))) are not being
properly aligned on the stack. The alignment attribute is parsed and stored in
the IR but the codegen backends do not honor it when computing stack frame layout.

Fix approach:
1. Propagate alignment requirements from IR alloca instructions to stack layout
2. In each backend's stack frame allocation, round up stack offsets to satisfy
   alignment requirements for aligned variables
3. For very large alignments (> 16), use AND masking on the stack pointer

This affects all three backends (x86, ARM, RISC-V).
