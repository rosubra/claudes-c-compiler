Fix vector compound assignment type inference bug (in_progress)

Bug: When doing `result += a * f` where result and a are vector types
(e.g., float4 via __attribute__((vector_size(16)))) and f is a scalar,
the expr_ctype for the RHS expression `a * f` returns `Float` instead of
`Vector(Float, 16)`.

This causes lower_vector_compound_assign to treat the RHS as a scalar
(broadcasting a pointer value as float), producing garbage results.

Root cause: get_binop_ctype calls usual_arithmetic_conversion which doesn't
handle CType::Vector, so Vector(Float,16) op Float returns Float.

Fix: Add vector type check in get_binop_ctype (and expr_ctype) so that
when either operand is a vector, the result type is that vector type.

Affects: gifsicle and potentially many other projects using GCC vector extensions.
