Fix wasm3 and nethack compilation (in_progress)
================================================

Two bugs fixed:

1. Linker library ordering: always append -lc/-lm at end of link command
   even if user already specified them, to resolve forward references from
   static archives (.a files) that appear after user's -l flags.
   This fixes wasm3 (and potentially other projects with similar link order).

2. Preprocessor pp-number suffix bug: substitute_params() was treating
   integer literal suffixes (L, UL, ULL, LL, etc.) as macro parameters
   when the parameter name matched the suffix. E.g., #define FOO(L,D) 10L
   expanded "10L" as "10" + expanded(L) instead of keeping "10L" intact.
   This fixes nethack (AppendLongDigit macro with parameter named L).
