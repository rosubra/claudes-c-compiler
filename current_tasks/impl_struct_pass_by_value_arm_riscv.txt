Implement struct pass-by-value ABI for ARM64 and RISC-V backends

x86 already has struct pass-by-value working (emit_call packs structs into registers,
emit_store_params unpacks them). ARM and RISC-V accept struct_arg_sizes but never use it.

ARM64 AAPCS ABI rules:
- Structs <= 16 bytes: passed in GP registers (x0-x7), each register gets up to 8 bytes
- Structs > 16 bytes: passed by pointer (caller copies to stack, passes address)
- Both emit_call (caller) and emit_store_params (callee) need updating

RISC-V LP64D ABI rules:
- Structs <= 16 bytes: passed in GP registers (a0-a7), similar to ARM
- Structs > 16 bytes: passed by pointer
- Both emit_call (caller) and emit_store_params (callee) need updating

This is the #1 failure category on ARM (81% struct-passing tests fail) and a major
failure category on RISC-V (55% struct assignment tests fail).

Status: IN PROGRESS
