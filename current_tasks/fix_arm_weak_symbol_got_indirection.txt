Task: Fix ARM64 weak symbol GOT indirection
Status: in_progress

Problem:
On AArch64, weak external symbols require GOT-indirect access (adrp + ldr :got:)
because the linker cannot use R_AARCH64_ADR_PREL_PG_HI21 for symbols that may
bind externally. GCC always uses GOT for weak symbols on AArch64, even in non-PIC
mode, because adrp cannot represent address 0 (which is what weak undefined symbols
resolve to).

Currently our compiler uses direct adrp+add for ALL global addresses on ARM, including
weak symbols. This causes linker errors when building the Linux kernel:
  "relocation R_AARCH64_ADR_PREL_PG_HI21 against symbol 'efi_arch_tables' which
   may bind externally can not be used when making a shared object"

Fix:
1. Add weak_symbols set to CodegenState
2. Populate it from module.symbol_attrs during codegen init
3. Add needs_got_weak() method that returns true for weak non-local symbols on ARM64
4. Modify ARM emit_global_addr to use adrp + ldr :got: for weak symbols

This is ARM64-specific - x86 and RISC-V handle weak symbols differently.
