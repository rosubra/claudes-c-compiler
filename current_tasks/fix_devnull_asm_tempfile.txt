Fix /dev/null assembly temp file path

Problem: When compiling with -c -o /dev/null (as musl's configure does),
the compiler fails with "Permission denied" because it tries to create
a temp .s file at /dev/null.PID.N.s, which is in the /dev/ directory.

Fix: Change backend/common.rs assemble() to use /tmp/ for temp .s files
instead of deriving the path from output_path. This matches what the
Full compilation mode already does.

This fix unblocks musl configure and any other project that uses
-o /dev/null for compiler detection.

Status: in progress
