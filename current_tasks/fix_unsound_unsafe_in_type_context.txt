Fix unsound unsafe code in type_context.rs

Wrapping struct_layouts and scope_stack in RefCell to eliminate three

This is undefined behavior per Rust's aliasing rules.

Files affected:
- src/frontend/sema/type_context.rs (main changes)
- ~20 files in src/ir/lowering/ and src/frontend/sema/ (caller updates)
