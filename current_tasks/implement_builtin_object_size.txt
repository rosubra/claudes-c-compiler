Implement __builtin_object_size builtin function.

Currently __builtin_object_size is recognized in the type checker but has no
lowering implementation. It falls through to a regular function call, causing
link failures in the Linux kernel (check_copy_size in thread_info.h references
__bad_copy_to/__bad_copy_from error symbols when __builtin_object_size doesn't
return -1 for unknown sizes).

Fix: Add __builtin_object_size to the builtin map and implement its lowering
to return (size_t)-1 for types 0/1 and 0 for types 2/3, matching GCC behavior
for cases where compile-time object size cannot be determined.
