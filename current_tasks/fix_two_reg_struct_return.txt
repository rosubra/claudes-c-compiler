Fix two-register struct return ABI for all architectures

Problem: When a function returns a struct that fits in 2 registers (9-16 bytes),
the IR lowering correctly packs the struct into an I128 value using Shl+Or,
but the function's return_type is never set to IrType::I128. This causes the
codegen to use the scalar return path (only setting a0, never a1).

The fix is in ir/lowering/lowering.rs: set the function's return_type to I128
when two_reg_ret_size is set.

This affects RISC-V primarily (many struct-passing tests fail), but also ARM.

Status: In progress
