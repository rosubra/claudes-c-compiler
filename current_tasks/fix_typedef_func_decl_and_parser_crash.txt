Task: Fix typedef function declarations emitted as BSS variables, and parser crash on EOF
Status: IN PROGRESS

Problem 1: Function typedef declarations (e.g., func_t add; where func_t is typedef int func_t(int))
were being emitted as BSS global variables with .type @object, conflicting with the actual function
definition later which uses .type @function. This caused assembly errors in mbedtls (ssl_cookie.c).

Problem 2: Parser advance() would panic with index out of bounds when reaching end of token stream
during error recovery on very large files (e.g., psa_crypto.c with 99436 tokens).

Fix:
- Added FunctionTypedefInfo struct and function_typedefs HashMap to track typedef'd function types
- In Pass 0 (typedef collection), detect and record function typedefs
- In Pass 1 (function name detection), also check for typedef-based function declarations
- In Pass 3 (lower_global_decl), skip declarations that use function typedefs
- In stmt.rs, handle block-scope typedef function declarations
- Fixed parser advance() to not panic when pos >= tokens.len()
