Fix ARM assembler data directive local label relocations

The ARM builtin assembler emits data directives like `.xword .Lstr0` with the raw
local label name as the relocation symbol. Since .L labels are excluded from the
symbol table, the relocation ends up with symbol index 0 (null/undefined), causing
NULL pointer dereferences at runtime.

The fix: resolve local label references in data directives to section-relative
relocations (section symbol + offset), matching what GCC's assembler does.

This also needs to be checked/fixed in the RISC-V and x86/i686 assemblers.

This fix is needed for sqlite and redis to work with MY_ASM=builtin on ARM.
