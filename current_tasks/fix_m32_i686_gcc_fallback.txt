Fix: -m32 flag incorrectly triggers gcc_fallback when target is already I686

When ccc-i686 is invoked with -m32 (e.g., by CMake), the -m32 handler
triggers gcc_fallback mode, which delegates to system gcc. But system gcc
is x86_64 and can't find 32-bit libgcc/libgcc_eh.

Fix: When the target is already I686 (set by binary name detection),
-m32 should be a no-op instead of triggering gcc_fallback.

This fixes cwalk (and likely other projects) failing on i686.
