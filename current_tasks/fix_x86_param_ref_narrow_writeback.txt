Task: Fix x86 emit_param_ref_impl skipping writeback for narrow types
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Problem:
When mem2reg promotes a parameter alloca to SSA, emit_param_ref_impl loads
the param value from its alloca slot using a type-appropriate instruction
(e.g., movslq for I32). However, when the dest SSA value shares the same
stack slot as the param alloca, the code skips the store-back as an
optimization ("value is already there from emit_store_params").

This is wrong for narrow types (I32, I16, I8, etc.) because emit_store_params
stores the param with a narrow instruction (e.g., movl for I32), leaving only
4 valid bytes in the 8-byte slot. Later movq loads from this slot read garbage
in the upper 32 bits, causing crashes (Bus error) in code that uses the value
as a 64-bit quantity (e.g., VLA size calculations, pointer arithmetic).

Fix:
Always write back the sign/zero-extended value when the param type is smaller
than 8 bytes, even when the dest shares the same slot.

Impact:
Fixes JerryScript VLA Bus errors and likely other projects with similar issues.
