Task: Fix x86 emit_param_ref_impl skipping writeback for narrow types
Status: completed
Started: 2026-01-30
Completed: 2026-01-30

Problem:
Three compiler bugs prevented JerryScript from passing its test suite.

Bug 1 - x86 narrow param writeback (prologue.rs):
When mem2reg promotes a parameter alloca to SSA, emit_param_ref_impl loads
the param value using a type-appropriate instruction (e.g., movslq for I32).
When the dest SSA value shares the same stack slot as the param alloca, the
code skipped the store-back. This is wrong for narrow types because
emit_store_params writes with a narrow instruction (movl), leaving upper
bytes undefined. Later movq loads read garbage.

Bug 2 - Compound literal address-of size (expr_access.rs):
lower_address_of for compound literals with incomplete array types
(e.g., &((int[]){1,2,3})) used sizeof_type which returns 0 for incomplete
arrays. This allocated a too-small stack buffer.

Bug 3 - VLA forward goto misidentification (stmt_control_flow.rs):
Multiple forward gotos to the same label in a function with VLAs caused
stack corruption. user_label_exists() checked user_labels which is populated
by both goto and label: statements. After the first goto created a
placeholder block, subsequent forward gotos were misidentified as backward
gotos, incorrectly emitting StackRestore that deallocated the VLA.

Fixes:
1. Always write back sign/zero-extended value for sub-64-bit param types
2. Extract compound_literal_size() helper for correct incomplete array sizing
3. Track defined labels separately in defined_user_labels set

Testing:
- All 48 project tests pass on all 4 architectures (x86, i686, arm, riscv)
- JerryScript passes on all 4 architectures
- All existing VLA tests pass
- New regression test: vla-goto-multiple-forward-no-dealloc
