Fix LICM index out of bounds panic at licm.rs:543

The merge_single_pred_blocks pass in cfg_simplify can create blocks where
source_spans is shorter than instructions (predecessor has spans, merged
successor does not). LICM then panics at old_spans[i] when removing
hoisted instructions from such blocks.

Fix:
1. Fix merge_single_pred_blocks to pad source_spans with dummy spans when
   the predecessor has spans but the merged successor does not.
2. Fix LICM to be defensive about span index bounds.

Status: in_progress
