Task: Refactor IR lowering module to reduce code duplication and complexity
Status: IN PROGRESS

Goal: Major cleanup of the IR lowering module which has the worst code quality:
- lowering.rs (2682 lines) - monolithic functions, deeply nested logic
- expr.rs (2726 lines) - duplicated patterns, massive function chains
- types.rs (2178 lines) - duplicated sizeof/alignof, repeated truthiness patterns

Planned changes:
1. Extract helper methods for repeated patterns (IrConst truthiness, bitfield resolution, etc.)
2. Add IrConst utility methods (is_nonzero, to_i64, etc.) to eliminate repeated match arms
3. Unify sizeof_type/alignof_type duplication in types.rs
4. Extract member access helper to deduplicate lower_member_access/lower_pointer_member_access
5. Consolidate intrinsic lowering (CLZ/CTZ/bswap/popcount use same pattern 4x)
6. Break up the 333-line fill_struct_global_bytes into smaller functions
7. Group Lowerer struct fields into logical sub-structs
8. Clean up eval_const_expr duplication
