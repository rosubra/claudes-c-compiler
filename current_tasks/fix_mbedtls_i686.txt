Fix mbedtls i686 with builtin assembler and linker

Two bugs found:
1. Missing AES-NI instructions (aesenc, aesenclast, aesdec, aesdeclast, aesimc, aeskeygenassist)
   in the i686 assembler - x86_64 had them already.

2. mnemonic_size_suffix bug: unsuffixed "sub" ends in 'b' which was misinterpreted as a byte-size
   suffix, causing "subl %ecx, %eax" to be encoded as "sub al, cl" (0x28 instead of 0x29).
   Same issue affects "sbb". Also preemptively fixed "add", "and", "shl", "rol", "xadd" which
   coincidentally end in 'd' or 'l' (getting the right size by luck).
