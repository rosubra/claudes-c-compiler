Implement \u and \U unicode escape sequences in string and character literals.

The lexer currently does not handle \uNNNN (4 hex digit) or \UNNNNNNNN (8 hex digit)
unicode escape sequences. These are required by C11 for string literals, character literals,
and u8 string literals.

When \u or \U appears in a string literal, it should produce the UTF-8 encoding of the
specified Unicode code point.
