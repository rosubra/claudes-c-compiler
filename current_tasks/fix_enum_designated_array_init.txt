Task: Fix enum constant values in designated array initializers
Status: completed

Problem: expr_might_be_addr() in global_init_helpers.rs treats ALL identifiers as
potential address expressions, including enum constants. This causes arrays with
enum-valued designated initializers (e.g., `{ [35] = INT }` where INT is an enum)
to be emitted via the Compound (.quad) path instead of the Array path, resulting
in wrong element sizes and all-zero values.

This bug prevented musl's vfprintf.c from working correctly (the states[][] array
uses enum values in designated initializers), causing printf with format specifiers
to silently fail.

Fix: Pass enum_constants map to init_contains_addr_expr/expr_might_be_addr so they
can distinguish enum constant identifiers from variable/function identifiers.
