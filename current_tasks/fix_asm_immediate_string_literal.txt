Task: fix_asm_immediate_string_literal
Status: completed
Description: Add peel_to_string_literal to handle cast-wrapped string literals in inline asm 'i' constraint
operands. Previously, string literals wrapped in casts (e.g., "i" (__FILE__)) were not recognized as
assembly-time constants, causing has_unsatisfiable_imm to skip the asm body including .pushsection data.
This caused NULL pointer crashes in the kernel PM trace subsystem (drivers/base/power/main.c).
