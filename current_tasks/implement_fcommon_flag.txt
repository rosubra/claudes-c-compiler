Task: Implement -fcommon/-fno-common driver flag
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Problem: The compiler silently ignores -fcommon, treating all tentative definitions
as BSS symbols (like -fno-common behavior). This causes "multiple definition" linker
errors when multiple TUs define the same tentative global variable, as happens in
Quake and other C projects that rely on -fcommon behavior.

Plan:
1. Add fcommon bool field to Driver
2. Parse -fcommon and -fno-common flags
3. After lowering, mark tentative definitions (zero-init, non-extern, non-static)
   as common when fcommon=true
4. Add regression test
5. Verify Quake and other projects pass
