Migrate ARM linker utility functions to use linker_common shared infrastructure.

The ARM linker (arm/linker/mod.rs) has local copies of load_file, load_archive,
load_thin_archive, member_resolves_undefined, register_symbols, merge_sections,
and allocate_common_symbols that duplicate what linker_common already provides.

The RISC-V linker was already migrated (commit 26f75d24). This task migrates the
ARM linker to use the shared infrastructure similarly, eliminating ~200+ lines of
duplicated code.

Scope: ARM linker only (x86 is a separate task).
