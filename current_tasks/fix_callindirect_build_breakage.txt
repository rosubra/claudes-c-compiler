Fix build breakage: CallIndirect not handled in optimization passes

The CallIndirect instruction was added to ir.rs but not handled in:
- passes/dce.rs (two match arms missing)
- passes/gvn.rs (one match arm missing)

This is breaking the build for everyone. Quick fix: add the missing
match arms to handle CallIndirect like Call (it has side effects,
can define a value, and is not suitable for GVN).
