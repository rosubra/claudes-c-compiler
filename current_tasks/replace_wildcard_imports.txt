Task: Replace wildcard imports with explicit imports

Status: in_progress

Goal: Replace all `use crate::ir::ir::*` (72 files) and
`use crate::frontend::parser::ast::*` (42 files) wildcard imports with
explicit imports listing only the types/functions actually used.

This is a pure style cleanup with zero functional changes. Wildcard imports
are the single most visible Rust code smell in the codebase:
- They pull 77+ symbols into scope per file from ir::ir alone
- They make it impossible to tell what each file actually depends on
- They block dead-code analysis by tools and humans
- They create implicit coupling (adding a new pub item silently imports it into 70+ files)

Approach: Mechanically replace each `use ...::*` with explicit named imports
for only the items actually used in that file.
