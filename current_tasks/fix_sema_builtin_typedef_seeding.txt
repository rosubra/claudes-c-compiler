Fix: seed built-in typedefs in sema's TypeContext

Problem: Sema's TypeContext started with an empty typedef map. When source code
used uint64_t without #include <stdint.h>, sema's resolve_typedef fell back to
CType::Int (32-bit). This caused functions returning uint64_t to be recorded with
wrong return types. The lowerer trusted sema's function signatures, producing
32-bit codegen (cltq truncation on x86-64) for 64-bit values.

Fix: Added seed_builtin_typedefs() to TypeContext::new() that pre-populates the
same standard C typedefs (uint64_t, size_t, int64_t, etc.) that the lowerer
already seeds. This ensures sema correctly resolves built-in type names during
semantic analysis, before the lowerer runs.

Impact: Fixes 11 flatcc JSON test failures caused by uint64_t trie-based keyword
matching being truncated to 32 bits. All 21 flatcc C tests now pass.

Files changed:
- src/frontend/sema/type_context.rs: Added seed_builtin_typedefs() method
- tests/builtin-uint64-typedef-return/: New regression test
- ideas/new_projects.txt: Updated flatcc status
