Task: Pass sema function signatures to the lowerer

Currently sema collects FunctionInfo (return types, param types, variadic status)
for every function, but the lowerer ignores this and re-derives the same information
from the raw AST. This is Step 3->4 of the sema expansion roadmap.

Changes:
1. Pass sema_result.functions to the Lowerer constructor (not just type_context)
2. Pre-populate lowerer's known_functions from sema's function map
3. Have register_function_meta use sema's CType info as source-of-truth
4. Wire sema warnings through the driver
5. Store sema function info in lowerer for later use by get_expr_ctype

This reduces duplicate work and establishes sema as the authority on function types.
