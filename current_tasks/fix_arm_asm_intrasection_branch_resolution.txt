Fix ARM assembler: resolve intra-section branch targets at assembly time

The ARM assembler emits R_AARCH64_CONDBR19, R_AARCH64_JUMP26, and R_AARCH64_CALL26
relocations for branches to labels defined within the same section, instead of
resolving the PC-relative offset at assembly time (like GAS does).

This causes the ARM kernel's head.S (arch/arm64/kernel/head.o) to have zero-offset
branches in .idmap.text, because the linker either doesn't handle these intra-section
relocations or the local symbols aren't matched correctly. The kernel fails to boot
because primary_entry branches to itself instead of to __primary_switch.

Fix: In the ARM assembler's ELF writer, when processing relocations for branch
instructions (B, B.cond, BL, CBZ, CBNZ, TBZ, TBNZ), check if the target symbol
is defined in the same section. If so, compute the offset directly and patch the
instruction, instead of emitting a relocation.

This is the same pattern used by GAS - intra-section branches are always resolved
at assembly time.
