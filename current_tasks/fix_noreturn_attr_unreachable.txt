Fix noreturn attribute: emit unreachable after calls to noreturn functions

Bug: Functions declared with __attribute__((noreturn)) or _Noreturn were parsed
but the attribute was silently discarded. This caused the compiler to emit
epilogue code (callee-saved register restores + ret) after calls to noreturn
functions like panic(). The Linux kernel build uses objtool to validate control
flow, and it rejects functions with code after calls to __noreturn functions,
causing boot failures when multiple CCC-compiled files were linked together.

Fix: Propagate the noreturn attribute through the parser AST to the IR lowerer,
and emit Terminator::Unreachable (ud2) after calls to noreturn functions,
following the same pattern as the existing error_functions handling.

Files changed:
- src/frontend/parser/parser.rs: Added parsing_noreturn flag, recognize
  noreturn/__noreturn__ in GCC attributes
- src/frontend/parser/types.rs: Set parsing_noreturn for _Noreturn keyword
- src/frontend/parser/ast.rs: Added is_noreturn field to InitDeclarator
- src/frontend/parser/declarations.rs: Propagate is_noreturn through declaration
  parsing pipeline
- src/ir/lowering/lowering.rs: Added noreturn_functions set, collect from
  declarators
- src/ir/lowering/expr_calls.rs: After emitting call to noreturn function,
  emit Unreachable terminator and start dead block

Status: completed
