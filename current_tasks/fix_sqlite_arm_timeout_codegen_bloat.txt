Task: Fix SQLite ARM timeout due to ARM codegen bloat
Status: in_progress

Problem:
SQLite ARM tests (4 of 84) timeout because our generated code is ~8x slower than GCC.
Root cause: sqlite3VdbeExec is 1.4MB with our compiler vs 34KB with GCC ARM (42x code bloat).

Key issues in ARM backend:
1. emit_int_cmp_insn always routes through x0 even when comparing a register against
   an immediate, generating 4+ instructions instead of 1 (cmp xN, #imm)
2. The fused cmp-branch pattern (b.inv_cc .skip; b true; .skip: b false) emits 3
   branch instructions per switch case instead of 1 conditional branch
3. No immediate operand optimization for ARM cmp instruction

Fix plan:
1. Optimize emit_int_cmp_insn to use cmp reg, #imm for small constants
2. Optimize emit_fused_cmp_branch to use single b.cc instruction when possible
3. This should dramatically reduce code size for switch-heavy functions like sqlite3VdbeExec
