Fix local register asm variable read (in_progress)

Bug: Local register asm variables without initializer (e.g., `register unsigned long r0 asm("r0")`)
incorrectly emit a new inline asm to read the physical hardware register when the variable is
referenced outside of inline asm. This reads the wrong value because the physical register has
been overwritten by other code since the inline asm that wrote to it.

Fix: For LOCAL register asm variables, always read from the alloca (stack slot), regardless of
whether they have an initializer. The register binding only affects inline asm constraint rewriting.
Only GLOBAL register variables should read the physical hardware register directly.

This fixes the register-asm-r-alias-arm test and any kernel code using the SMCCC register
variable pattern.
