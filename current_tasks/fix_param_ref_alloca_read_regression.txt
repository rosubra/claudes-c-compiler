Task: Fix ParamRef alloca read regression on ARM (and other backends)
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: Commit a3307c7 introduced ParamRef instructions that read directly
from ABI registers (x0-x7 on ARM). This causes two bugs:

1. Stack-passed params (9th+ on ARM): emit_param_ref used a hardcoded
   stack_base=16 instead of frame_size, reading from the wrong stack location.

2. Register params: By the time emit_param_ref runs during instruction
   generation, emit_store_params may have already clobbered the ABI registers
   (x0 is used as scratch during float/stack param storage phases).

Additionally, the dead_param_allocas detection marked param allocas as dead
when they had no IR uses (after mem2reg promotion), causing emit_store_params
to skip saving those registers entirely.

Fix:
- emit_param_ref now reads from the param alloca stack slot (where
  emit_store_params saved the value) instead of from ABI registers
- dead_param_allocas no longer marks param allocas as dead when there
  are ParamRef instructions referencing them
- Pre-compute param_alloca_slots during emit_store_params for all backends

Impact: sqlite (0% -> 100%), lua, mbedtls, jq all fixed on ARM.
