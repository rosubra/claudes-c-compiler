Task: Fix spurious pre-load for "+m" inline asm constraints
Status: in_progress

Problem:
For "+m" (read-write memory) constraints in inline assembly, the IR lowering
was emitting a Load instruction to read the current value of the memory operand.
This Load was never used by the backend (which correctly skips pre-loads for
memory-only operands), but it still executed at runtime and could crash when:
- The memory address is only valid with a segment prefix (e.g., %gs: for
  per-CPU variables in the Linux kernel)
- The raw pointer dereference without the segment prefix causes a page fault

This caused kernel boot failures when compiling files that use per-CPU variables
with inline asm (e.g., mm/slub.c, drivers/gpu/drm/drm_vma_manager.c).

Fix:
Skip the IR-level Load instruction for memory-only "+m" constraints, since
the inline asm reads/writes memory directly through the template string.
Use the pointer value as a placeholder operand for correct operand numbering.
