Fix backend consistency issues across ARM and RISC-V codegens:
1. ARM URem uses sdiv instead of udiv
2. ARM and RISC-V casts are no-ops (should emit sign/zero extension)
3. ARM and RISC-V lack 32-bit arithmetic for I32/U32 types
4. RISC-V uses slt for unsigned comparisons (should use sltu)
5. RISC-V Call clobbers earlier args when loading later ones
