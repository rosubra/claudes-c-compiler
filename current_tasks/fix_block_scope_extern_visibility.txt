Task: Fix block-scope extern visibility pragma handling
Status: in_progress

Problem: #pragma GCC visibility push(hidden) was not applied to block-scope
extern variable declarations. This caused GOT-indirect addressing (adrp :got:)
instead of PC-relative addressing (adrp + add :lo12:) in PIC/PIE mode,
breaking the Linux kernel's position-independent early boot code on AArch64.

Fix:
1. Parser: parse_local_declaration() now falls back to pragma_default_visibility
   for block-scope declarations (matching file-scope behavior).
2. Lowering: lower_extern_decl() now propagates visibility to module.symbol_attrs
   for block-scope extern variables (matching block-scope extern functions).
