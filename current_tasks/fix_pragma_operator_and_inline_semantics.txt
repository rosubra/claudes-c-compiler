Task: Implement _Pragma operator and fix GNU inline function semantics
Status: In progress

Goals:
1. Implement _Pragma("...") operator in the preprocessor
   - _Pragma is a C99 operator that acts like #pragma but can appear in macro expansions
   - Should be silently consumed (our pragmas are mostly no-ops anyway)
   - This fixes jq build which uses _Pragma("GCC diagnostic push/pop") extensively

2. Fix inline function without static to emit external definition (GNU semantics)
   - In GNU C mode (default), `inline` without `static` should emit an externally
     visible definition, not skip the function
   - This fixes the undefined reference to `tsd_dtoa_context_get` in jq

Both are needed to unblock jq project compilation.
