Task: Add FFmpeg as a verified project

FFmpeg compiles, links, and runs correctly with ccc-x86.
- All 83 checkasm FATE tests pass
- Video encoding/decoding works (mpeg4, mjpeg, mpeg2video)
- Audio encoding/decoding works (pcm, sine generation)
- Complex filter graphs work (scale, hflip, amerge)
- ffmpeg and ffprobe binaries produce correct output

Adding FFmpeg to the verified projects list and documenting the build process.
