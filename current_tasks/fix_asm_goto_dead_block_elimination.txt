Fix: asm goto target blocks incorrectly removed by dead block elimination

The CFG simplify pass had a bug where asm goto target blocks were removed when
the asm had unsatisfiable immediate constraints (e.g., in standalone bodies of
static __always_inline functions where "i" constraint parameters can't be
resolved). The dead block elimination would suppress goto label reachability,
but the backend still emits the asm body with $0 placeholders, causing the
linker to fail with "undefined reference to '.L30'" when the asm template
references the deleted label in .pushsection directives like __jump_table.

Fix: Always mark asm goto target blocks as reachable, since the backend always
emits the asm body. Also added defensive cleanup of dangling goto_labels in
InlineAsm instructions when blocks are removed for any reason.
