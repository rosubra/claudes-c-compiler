Fix pointer-to-pointer-to-array subscript bug (in_progress)
==========================================================
Date: 2026-01-27

Bug: When a variable is declared as T (**pp)[N] (pointer-to-pointer-to-array),
subscript operations pp[i] incorrectly stride by sizeof(T[N]) instead of
sizeof(pointer), and skip the required pointer dereference.

Root cause: compute_decl_info in types.rs treats char (**pp)[2] the same as
char (*p)[2], putting array strides [2, 1] in array_dim_strides. This causes
get_array_elem_size_for_subscript to use stride 2 instead of 8, and
subscript_result_is_array to return true (skipping the load).

Fix: When ptr_count >= 2 in the "pointer to array" branch, return empty
strides and elem_size=8, so the variable is treated as a simple pointer-to-pointer.
CType-based inference will handle deeper subscript levels correctly.

Affected test: compiler_suite_0048_0120 (test 8 - multi-level pointer cast indexing)
