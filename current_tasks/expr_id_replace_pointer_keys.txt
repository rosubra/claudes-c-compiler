Task: Replace pointer-as-usize HashMap keys with proper ExprId

Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-28

Problem:
Sema uses `expr as *const Expr as usize` as a HashMap key to cache expression types
and constant values. This is technically sound since AST nodes don't move in Rust,
but it's an exotic pattern that:
1. Confuses contributors
2. Requires ABA-detection guards (discriminant checks) in the lowerer
3. Would break silently if the AST representation ever changed (e.g., arena allocation)

Solution:
Add an ExprId (u32 counter) to each Expr node, assigned during parsing.
Replace all `expr as *const Expr as usize` patterns with `expr.id()` lookups.
This eliminates the ABA problem entirely and makes the caching mechanism explicit
and safe.

Files affected:
- src/frontend/parser/ast.rs (add ExprId to Expr variants or wrapper)
- src/frontend/parser/expressions.rs (assign IDs during parsing)
- src/frontend/sema/sema.rs (use ExprId instead of pointer keys)
- src/frontend/sema/type_checker.rs (use ExprId)
- src/frontend/sema/const_eval.rs (use ExprId)
- src/ir/lowering/expr_types.rs (use ExprId, remove ABA guards)
- src/ir/lowering/const_eval.rs (use ExprId)
- src/ir/lowering/lowering.rs (use ExprId, simplify cache)
