Task: Fix pointer dereference + array index stride bug

The compiler uses incorrect element stride when indexing through a chained
dereference expression like (*fn_returning_ptr_to_ptr())[index].

Example: (*__ctype_b_loc())[(int)(c)] uses stride 8 (pointer size) instead
of stride 2 (unsigned short size). This breaks all ctype.h macros (isalnum,
isdigit, etc.) and causes postgres verification to fail.

Root cause: When lowering an array index expression where the base is a
dereference of a function call returning T**, the element type is computed
as T* (pointer, 8 bytes) instead of T (the pointed-to type, 2 bytes).

Status: In progress
