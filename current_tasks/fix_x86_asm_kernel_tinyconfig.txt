Fix x86 assembler issues preventing kernel tinyconfig build with standalone assembler.

Issues to fix:
1. .byte hex literal parsing (0x0f treated as label)
2. Debug register support (db0, db7)
3. lar instruction
4. invlpg instruction
5. UNWIND_HINT_REGS bad base register
6. cmp immediate form
7. range index out of bounds internal error
