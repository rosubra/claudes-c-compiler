Fix inline asm operand loading: use LEA for allocas instead of MOV

Problem: When an array or struct is passed to inline asm via the "r" constraint,
the backend emits `movq offset(%rbp), %reg` which loads the first 8 bytes of
the array contents. It should emit `leaq offset(%rbp), %reg` to load the ADDRESS
of the array into the register.

This affects ~250 asm tests that SIGSEGV because the inline asm tries to
dereference array contents as a pointer.

Fix location: backend/x86/codegen/asm_emitter.rs load_input_to_reg function.
Need to check is_alloca() and use lea for allocas, mov for non-allocas.
May also need to check ARM and RISC-V backends for the same issue.

Status: in_progress
