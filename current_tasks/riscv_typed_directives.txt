Refactor RISC-V assembler directives from string-bag pattern to typed enum.

Replace the untyped Directive { name: String, args: String } variant in
the RISC-V parser's AsmStatement with a fully typed Directive enum where
each directive kind has structured fields (e.g., Globl(String), Align(u64),
Byte(Vec<DataValue>), Section{name, flags, sec_type}, etc.).

Move all directive argument parsing from the ELF writer into the parser,
so the ELF writer just pattern-matches on typed variants without any
string re-parsing.
