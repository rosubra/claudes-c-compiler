Task: Fix CFG simplification pass regression that breaks zlib/lua

The CFG simplification pass (commit 1a4b937) introduced a regression that
causes zlib decompression to fail with "large inflate error: -3" and causes
lua to hang/timeout. The pass works on 19e227a (before) but fails on 1a4b937.

The regression likely involves incorrect dead block elimination, jump
threading, or branch simplification that miscompiles control flow in
inflate() or similar complex functions.

Status: In progress
