Fix ARM linker IPLT stubs gap error

The ARM linker fails with "IPLT stubs (N bytes) don't fit in RX padding (gap=M)"
when the natural gap between the RX segment end and the page-aligned RW segment
start is too small for the IPLT stubs.

Fix: count IFUNC symbols before page-aligning the RW segment boundary, and ensure
sufficient padding exists for IPLT stubs.
