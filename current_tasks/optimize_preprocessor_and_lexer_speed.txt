Task: Optimize preprocessor and lexer speed
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Goal: Reduce allocation overhead in the preprocessor and lexer hot paths.

Changes:
1. join_continued_lines: Return Cow<str> to avoid allocation when no continuations exist
2. strip_block_comments: Skip line_map allocation when no block comments present
3. preprocess_source: Skip line_map lookups when identity mapping
4. from_keyword: Add length-based pre-filter for fast reject of non-keywords
