Task: Fix asm goto with input operands and .pushsection being completely dropped from output

Bug: When an asm goto statement has both input operands (like "i" constraints) and goto labels,
AND the asm body uses .pushsection/.popsection directives (e.g., to create __jump_table entries),
the entire inline assembly is dropped from the output.

This causes the Linux kernel's static branch/jump label mechanism to break, because the __jump_table
section entries are never emitted. This prevents the kernel from dynamically patching branches at
boot time, causing boot failures.

Affected kernel patterns:
- static_branch_likely/unlikely (uses arch_static_branch / arch_static_branch_jump)
- _static_cpu_has (uses ALTERNATIVE_TERNARY with asm goto)
- These are used extensively in arch/x86/mm/tlb.c, drivers/acpi/*, crypto/*, etc.

Status: in_progress
