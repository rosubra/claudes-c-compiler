Fix ARM indirect call x17 clobber: function pointer stored in x17 gets
clobbered by large-offset stack helpers (emit_load_from_sp, emit_store_to_sp,
emit_add_sp_offset) during argument setup. The fix spills the function pointer
to a dedicated stack slot and reloads it right before the blr instruction.

This caused crashes (segfaults jumping to stack addresses) in any ARM-compiled
code with indirect calls and large stack frames (offsets > 4095), including
sqlite3's VDBE interpreter.
