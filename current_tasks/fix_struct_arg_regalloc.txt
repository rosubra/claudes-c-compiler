Fix struct-by-value argument passing when the source operand is register-allocated.

The RISC-V (and ARM) emit_call_stack_args and emit_call_reg_args functions for
LargeStructStack, StructByValStack, and StructByValReg argument classes don't
check reg_assignments when loading the source pointer. If the IR value holding
the struct pointer is register-allocated to a callee-saved register (not in a
stack slot), the code loads from an uninitialized stack slot causing SIGSEGV.

This manifests as crashes when passing _Complex long double via pointer
dereference (e.g., bar(*p) where p is _Complex long double*).

Fix: add reg_assignments check in the struct arg loading paths, matching the
pattern already used in operand_to_t0 / operand_to_rax.
