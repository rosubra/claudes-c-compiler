Expand sema's const_eval to return IrConst (Step 5 of typed-AST plan)

Goal: Upgrade sema's eval_const_expr from Option<i64> to Option<IrConst>,
matching the lowerer's richer result type. This enables:
- Float literal evaluation in sema (F32, F64, LongDouble)
- Proper cast chain evaluation with bit-width tracking
- Binary operations with proper type-aware semantics
- sizeof(expr) via ExprTypeChecker
- Storing pre-computed constants in a ConstMap for the lowerer

The lowerer will try sema's pre-computed values first, then fall back to
its own evaluation for lowering-specific cases (global addresses,
func_state const locals, etc).

This is Step 5 of the high_sema_expansion_typed_ast.txt plan.
