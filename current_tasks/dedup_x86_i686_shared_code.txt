Task: Deduplicate shared code between x86 and i686 backends

Status: in_progress

Goal: Extract duplicated functions between x86 and i686 backends into a shared
x86_common module. This includes:

1. gcc_cc_to_x86 - exact duplicate in both inline_asm modules
2. Register conversion functions (reg_to_32, reg_to_16, reg_to_8l, reg_to_8h) -
   near-duplicates that can be merged to accept both 64-bit and 32-bit register names
3. substitute_*_asm_operands - ~150 lines of identical template parsing logic
4. i686 internal dedup - mov_store/load_for_type duplicated within i686 itself

Approach: Create a backend/x86_common.rs module containing shared free functions,
then update both x86 and i686 backends to call the shared versions.

Impact: Eliminates ~300+ lines of copy-paste duplication, improving maintainability.
No functional changes.
