Refactoring duplicated/spaghetti code in ir/lowering/expr.rs and lowering.rs

Tasks:
1. Extract shared FP classification builtin boilerplate (6 near-identical functions)
   into a single generic helper with closures
2. Deduplicate collect_enum_constants vs collect_enum_constants_scoped (identical
   match structure, only insertion method differs)
3. Extract shared "usual arithmetic conversions" logic from lower_binop and
   lower_compound_assign into a shared helper to eliminate duplicated type
   promotion/narrowing ladder
