Fix -Wreturn-type false positive for GCC statement expressions containing return

The UNSUPPORTED macro in Linux kernel's tools/objtool/weak.c uses a GCC statement
expression ({ ... return ENOSYS; }). The return inside a statement expression is a
return from the enclosing function, so the expression should be treated as non-falling-through.

Currently, is_noreturn_call() doesn't handle Expr::StmtExpr, so the compiler thinks the
function body falls through and emits a spurious "control reaches end of non-void function" error.

Fix: Handle Expr::StmtExpr in the fall-through analysis by checking if the compound
statement inside it can fall through.
