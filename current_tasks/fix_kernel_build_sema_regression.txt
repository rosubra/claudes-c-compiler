Fix kernel build regression: GEN_BINARY_RMWcc / init_on_free macro expansion

Both x86 and RISC-V kernel builds fail on HEAD (post-commit db5607c8).
The kernel built successfully at commit b784ad5f.

x86 error: GEN_BINARY_RMWcc_5 implicit declaration in arch/x86/include/asm/bitops.h
RISC-V error: init_on_free undeclared in include/linux/mm.h

Root cause investigation: likely preprocessor macro expansion issue.
