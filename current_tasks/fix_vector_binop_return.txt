Fix vector binary operation return values

Problem: When a function returns the result of a vector binary operation
(e.g., `return x / y` where x, y are vector types), the result is returned
as a pointer to stack memory instead of packed register data.

Root cause: struct_value_size() didn't handle Expr::BinaryOp or Expr::UnaryOp,
so try_small_struct_return() couldn't recognize vector binary op results.
Additionally, get_binop_ctype() didn't preserve vector types, so get_expr_ctype()
returned the wrong type for vector binary operations.

Fix:
1. Add BinaryOp and UnaryOp to struct_value_size match arms
2. Add vector type preservation in get_binop_ctype before usual_arithmetic_conversion

Status: in_progress
