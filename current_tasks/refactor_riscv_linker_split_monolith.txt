Refactor RISC-V linker: split 4600-line link.rs monolith into modules.

The RISC-V linker has several problems:
1. link.rs is 4603 lines with two ~2000-line monolithic functions (link_builtin, link_shared)
2. Helper functions at the bottom of link.rs (lines 4106-4603) are exact duplicates
   of functions already in relocations.rs (patch_*, align_up, pad_to, etc.)
3. Structs (GlobalSym, MergedSection, etc.) defined in both link.rs and relocations.rs

Plan:
- Remove all duplicate helper functions from link.rs, use relocations.rs versions instead
- Remove duplicate struct definitions from link.rs
- Remove duplicate relocation constants from link.rs
- Update link.rs imports to use relocations module
- Update README
