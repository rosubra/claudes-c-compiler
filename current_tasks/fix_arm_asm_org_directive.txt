Fix ARM assembler .org directive implementation

The .org directive is completely ignored in the ARM assembler (parser.rs
line 1636-1639, treated as AsmDirective::Ignored). This is critical for
the Linux kernel's vector table, which uses `.org .Lventry_start + 128`
to pad each vector entry to exactly 128 bytes.

Without .org support, the vector table entries are not properly padded,
causing all branch targets to be wrong and the ARM kernel to fail to boot
in standalone mode (even though it builds successfully).

Fix: Implement .org as a directive that pads the current section to the
specified offset with zeros (matching GAS behavior).
