Fix RISC-V "A" constraint input lowering

The RISC-V "A" constraint (used for AMO/LR/SC instructions) is not being
lowered correctly for input-only operands. When used as an input like:
  asm("lr.w %0, %1" : "=r"(ret) : "A"(*ptr) : "memory")

The compiler loads the VALUE at *ptr instead of providing the ADDRESS of
*ptr. This causes SIGBUS crashes because the value (e.g., 42) is used
as a memory address for lr.w.

Fix: Add 'A' to the constraint_is_memory_only() check in the shared
inline asm framework, so the IR lowering provides the lvalue (address)
for "A" constraints instead of the rvalue (loaded value).

This is the RISC-V equivalent of AArch64's "Q" constraint which is
already handled correctly.
