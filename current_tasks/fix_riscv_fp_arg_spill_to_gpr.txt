Task: Fix RISC-V FP argument spill to integer registers

Problem: When a function has more than 8 floating-point arguments, the RISC-V LP64D ABI
says excess FP args should spill to integer registers (a0-a7) before going to the stack.

The caller (emit_call) correctly spills excess FP args to integer registers.
The callee (emit_store_params) incorrectly treats excess FP args as stack-passed,
reading them from the wrong location.

This causes functions with >8 FP args to produce wrong results on RISC-V.

Fix: Update emit_store_params to route excess FP args through integer registers,
matching the caller's classification logic.
