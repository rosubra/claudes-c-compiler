Fix RIOT build failure: add __atomic_load_N and __atomic_store_N (size-suffixed) builtins.

RIOT uses __atomic_load_1, __atomic_load_2, __atomic_load_4, __atomic_store_1,
__atomic_store_2, __atomic_store_4 which are GCC size-suffixed variants of
__atomic_load_n and __atomic_store_n. Our compiler doesn't recognize these
(implicit declaration error), but GCC treats them as builtins.

Fix:
1. Add strip_atomic_size_suffix() to strip _1/_2/_4/_8/_16 from __atomic_* names
2. Use it in is_atomic_builtin() and try_lower_atomic_builtin()
