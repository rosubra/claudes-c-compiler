Task: Deduplicate ELF writer numeric label resolution and shared structures

The ELF writers (assembler output) across x86, i686, and RISC-V all implement
nearly identical numeric label resolution logic:
- is_numeric_label() / parse_numeric_ref() / resolve_numeric_labels()
- Each ~60-85 lines, same algorithm, same .Lnum_N_K naming scheme

Also, the Section/ElfReloc/ElfSymbol structs are duplicated across all 4 backends
(ARM and RISC-V are character-for-character identical).

Plan:
1. Extract shared numeric label resolution into backend/elf.rs
2. Unify Section/ElfReloc/ElfSymbol into shared types (or at minimum a shared trait)
3. Remove duplicated code from x86, i686, RISC-V ELF writers
4. Migrate x86 ELF writer to use shared write_relocatable_object()

Expected savings: ~600+ lines of duplicated code removed.
