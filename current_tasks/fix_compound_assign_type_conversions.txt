Task: Fix compound assignment type conversion bugs

The compound assignment operator (e.g., /=, %=, *=) currently uses the
LHS type's signedness for the operation, but C semantics require using
the usual arithmetic conversions (common type) of both operands.

Examples:
- unsigned int x = -1u; x /= -10l;  → should use signed long division
- int i = -50; *i_ptr %= 4294967200U; → should use unsigned int modulo

The fix determines the common type's signedness and uses that for the
binary operation in compound assignment lowering.
