Fix vector return value handling in IR lowering

The compiler treats small vector types (e.g., v4qi = unsigned char vector_size(4))
as pointers when returned from functions. This causes the caller to interpret the
actual packed vector data in rax/x0 as a memory address and segfault when trying
to memcpy from it.

The fix: treat vector return types like struct return types in the ABI classification,
so small vectors (<=8 bytes) are returned as I64, and larger ones use sret.

Affects: all backends (x86, arm, riscv) - this is an IR-level bug.
