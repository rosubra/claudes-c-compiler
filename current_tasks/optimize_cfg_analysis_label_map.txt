Task: Optimize CFG analysis label_to_idx map from FxHashMap to dense Vec
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Goal: Speed up the compiler by replacing the FxHashMap<BlockId, usize> label-to-index
lookup used in CFG analysis (build_label_map, build_cfg) with a dense Vec<u32> lookup
table indexed by BlockId.0. Since BlockIds are sequential small integers, a Vec gives
O(1) lookup instead of hash table lookup.

This affects all passes that compute CFG info: GVN, LICM, CFG simplify, if-convert,
mem2reg, and phi_eliminate - called 6+ times per function per optimization iteration.

Also add per-pass timing diagnostics when CCC_TIME_PHASES=1 is set.
