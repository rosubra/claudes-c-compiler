Task: Fix miscompilation of mm/pgtable-generic.c causing kernel boot failure
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-26

The kernel file mm/pgtable-generic.c is miscompiled by ccc, causing the kernel
to fail to boot when this single file is compiled with ccc instead of gcc.
This file handles generic page table operations. Need to identify root cause
by comparing ccc and gcc assembly output and fix the compiler bug.
