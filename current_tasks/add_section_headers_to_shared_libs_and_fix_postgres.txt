Fix PostgreSQL build by:
1. Adding section headers to emitted .so files so they can be consumed by our own linker
2. Adding PT_DYNAMIC fallback in parse_shared_library_symbols for .so files without section headers
3. Handle -Wl,-rpath and --enable-new-dtags flags needed by PostgreSQL
4. Fix any other issues preventing postgres from building and passing tests
