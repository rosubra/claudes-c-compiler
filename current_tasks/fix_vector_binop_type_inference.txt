Lock: fix_vector_binop_type_inference (completed)

Two bugs diagnosed that were causing gifsicle to fail on all architectures:

Bug 1: Vector binary operation type inference returns scalar type instead of vector type.
Root cause: get_binop_ctype and infer_binop_ctype called usual_arithmetic_conversion
which doesn't handle vector types, losing the vector type on scalar*vector operations.
Fix (lowerer): Added vector type check in get_binop_ctype (upstream independently applied)
Fix (sema): Added matching vector type check in infer_binop_ctype (our contribution)
File: src/frontend/sema/type_checker.rs

Bug 2: x86-64 struct return ABI mismatch when function contains internal calls.
Root cause: current_ret_classes shared between function return and call-site return ABI,
overwritten by each call within the function, empty by return time.
Fix: Upstream independently applied call_ret_classes separation.

Our final commit adds:
  - Sema vector type check (infer_binop_ctype) to complement the lowerer fix
  - Regression test: vector-scalar-binop-type-inference
  - Regression test: struct-ret-sse-int-callee-call-x86

Verification:
  gifsicle: all 12 tests + smoke tests pass on x86, i686, arm, riscv
  Unit tests (full, all pre-existing failures):
    x86:   726/727 (99.9%)
    ARM:   664/665 (99.8%)
    RISCV: 676/676 (100.0%)
    i686:  633/635 (99.7%)
  Projects: 47/48 pass (mbedtls i686 pre-existing parse error)
Status: completed
