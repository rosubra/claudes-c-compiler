Fix struct return ABI: use two-register return (rax+rdx) for 9-16 byte structs

Currently the compiler uses sret (hidden pointer) for ALL structs > 8 bytes.
Per SysV AMD64 ABI (and equivalent ARM64/RISC-V ABIs), structs of 9-16 bytes
with all-integer fields should be returned in two registers (rax+rdx on x86,
x0+x1 on ARM64, a0+a1 on RISC-V), not via sret.

This causes:
1. ABI incompatibility with GCC for functions returning 9-16 byte structs
2. Segfaults when such functions are called via function pointers (indirect calls
   don't prepend the sret pointer, creating a mismatch)
3. jq test failures (jv is a 16-byte struct passed/returned extensively)

Fix:
- Change sret threshold from > 8 to > 16 bytes
- Pack 9-16 byte struct returns into rax:rdx pair (using I128 IR type)
- Unpack two-register returns at call sites into struct allocas
- Also fix indirect calls to handle sret for truly large structs (> 16 bytes)
