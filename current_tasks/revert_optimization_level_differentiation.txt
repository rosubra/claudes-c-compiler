Revert optimization level differentiation (commit 78c9b48f)
============================================================
Started: 2026-02-05

Reverting commit 78c9b48f which introduced multiple optimization tiers
(-O0, -O1, -O2). The project should use a single optimization level for
all -O flags to maximize test coverage and avoid hard-to-find bugs that
only surface at specific optimization tiers.

Will add an explanatory comment about why single-level optimization is
important for this project's stability.
