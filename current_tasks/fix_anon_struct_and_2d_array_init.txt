Task: Fix anonymous struct/union init and 2D struct array init
Status: DONE

Fixes:
1. Anonymous struct/union positional initialization: The resolve_init_field_idx
   function was skipping unnamed fields during positional init, preventing anonymous
   struct/union members from receiving initializer data.
   
2. Multi-dimensional array of structs initialization: Global init of struct type[N][M]
   was using struct_size as the outer stride instead of elem_size (row size), causing
   only the first row to be initialized. Also, sub-array init lists (rows) were being
   treated as single struct inits rather than arrays of struct inits.

Tested: Both local and global init of anonymous structs/unions, flat and braced init,
2D struct arrays with all elements verified. All existing integration tests pass.
