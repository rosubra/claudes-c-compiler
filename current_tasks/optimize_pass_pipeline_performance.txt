Optimize the compiler's optimization pass pipeline for faster compilation.

Profiling on SQLite (265K lines) shows these hotspots in our code:
1. cfg_simplify (2.24%) - has O(n^2) linear block lookups in fold_constant_cond_branches
   and thread_jump_chains that scan all blocks to find one by label
2. copy_prop (1.90%) - wasteful iter().any() scan of entire copy_map Vec
3. licm (1.49%) - allocates Vec<u32> per instruction in hot fixpoint loop
4. dce (1.34%) - runs to fixpoint, rebuilds bitvector each iteration

Key optimizations:
- Add label-to-index maps in cfg_simplify to avoid O(n^2) block lookups
- Add early-exit flags in copy_prop to avoid scanning empty copy maps
- Reduce Vec allocations in LICM hot loops
- Minor scheduling improvements in pass runner

Status: in_progress
