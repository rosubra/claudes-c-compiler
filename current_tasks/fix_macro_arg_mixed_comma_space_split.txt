Fix macro arg splitting when invocation uses both commas and spaces as separators.

Bug: `fixup lb a5, 0(a1), 10f` should produce 4 args (lb, a5, 0(a1), 10f)
but currently produces 3 args (lb a5, 0(a1), 10f) because comma-only mode
prevents space splitting within comma fields.

GNU as always splits on both commas and spaces, merging expression tokens
connected by operators (+, -, *, etc.). The fix needs to split comma fields
further on spaces while preserving expression tokens.

This breaks arch/riscv/lib/uaccess.S in the kernel build.
