Task: Fix uppercase \E escape sequence in lexer

Status: in_progress

Problem:
The lexer handles \e (lowercase) as the ESC character (0x1B) which is a GCC extension,
but \E (uppercase) is treated as an unknown escape sequence, producing the literal 'E' (69).

GCC treats both \e and \E as the escape character (0x1B).

This causes test failures in compiler_suite_0151_0080 (string literal test TKC05.22)
where the string L"\E" should produce ESC (0x1B) not 'E' (69).

Fix:
Add 'E' alongside 'e' in the lexer's escape sequence handling to produce 0x1B.
