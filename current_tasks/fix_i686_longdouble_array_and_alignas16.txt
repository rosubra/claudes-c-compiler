Fix two i686 bugs:
1. Multi-dimensional long double array initialization used hardcoded /16 divisor
   instead of elem_size, causing truncated static data on i686 (sizeof(long double)=12).
2. _Alignas(16) local variables not properly 16-byte aligned on i686 because
   the stack slot assignment didn't account for %ebp's alignment bias
   (%ebp mod 16 == 8 on i686 ABI).
