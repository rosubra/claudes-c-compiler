Fix __aligned__() attribute parsing to handle nested parentheses

Problem: The parser's __aligned__(expr) attribute argument parsing uses a flat
token skip loop (while not RParen, advance) which doesn't track nesting depth.
When the alignment expression contains nested parentheses like __alignof__(type),
the inner ) is mistakenly consumed as the aligned() closing paren, leaving
the outer ) as an unmatched token that causes "expected Semicolon, got RParen".

This breaks any C code that includes stddef.h (which has max_align_t with
__aligned__(__alignof__(long long))), affecting mbedtls and many other projects.

Fix: Replace the flat skip loop in parse_gcc_attributes with proper balanced
parenthesis tracking for the aligned argument.

Status: In progress
