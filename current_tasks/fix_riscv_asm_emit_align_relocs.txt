Task: Emit R_RISCV_ALIGN relocations in RISC-V assembler

Problem: The RISC-V assembler does not emit R_RISCV_ALIGN relocations at
.align/.balign/.p2align directives. When the system linker (riscv64-linux-gnu-ld)
performs relaxation (enabled when CONFIG_RISCV_USE_LINKER_RELAXATION=y in the
kernel), it shrinks instructions but cannot fix alignment because R_RISCV_ALIGN
markers are missing. This causes boot failure for the RISC-V kernel with defconfig.

Fix: Emit R_RISCV_ALIGN relocations alongside NOP padding when relaxation is
enabled (no_relax == false) in the assembler's alignment directive handler.
