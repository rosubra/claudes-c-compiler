Refactor: Decompose emit_struct_init and clean up struct initialization code

The emit_struct_init function in src/ir/lowering/stmt.rs is 533 lines with
13 levels of nesting - the worst spaghetti code in the codebase.

Plan:
1. Decompose emit_struct_init into 5-6 sub-functions by field type:
   - emit_struct_field_nested_struct: nested struct/union init
   - emit_struct_field_array: array field initialization (designated + flat)
   - emit_struct_field_complex: complex number field init
   - emit_struct_field_scalar: scalar/bitfield init
   - emit_array_field_designated: .field[idx] designator handling

2. Extract struct initialization code from stmt.rs into struct_init.rs
   (stmt.rs is 1952 lines, ~80% of which is init logic, not statement lowering)

3. Remove dead code (count_operand_uses in regalloc.rs)

4. Update READMEs

High-risk: this function has many subtle edge cases tested by the test suite.
Will verify with the full test suite before and after.
