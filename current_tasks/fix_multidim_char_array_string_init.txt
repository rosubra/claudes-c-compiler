Fix multi-dimensional char array string literal initializer stride computation.

When a designated string literal initializes an inner array in a multi-dim char array
(e.g., char arr[2][5] = { [0] = "ABCD" }), the stride calculation was using
the stride *after* the designator level instead of *at* the designator level,
causing incorrect element counts.
