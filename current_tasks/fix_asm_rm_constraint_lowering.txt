Fix inline asm "rm" (register-or-memory) constraint lowering

Bug: When a constraint like "rm" is used, the IR lowering phase treats it as a
memory constraint and lowers the input as an lvalue (address/pointer). But the
backend classifies "rm" as GpReg (registers preferred over memory), so it tries
to load the value into a register. Since the value was lowered as an alloca
pointer, load_input_to_reg sees is_alloca=true and emits leaq (address) instead
of a value load.

Result: All "rm" constraint inputs get the ADDRESS of the variable instead of
the VALUE. This causes ~50 inline asm test failures on x86 (bsf, bsr, bswap,
crc32, divq, imulq, and many more always produce wrong results).

Fix: Change the lowering logic to only use lower_lvalue for constraints that
are purely memory (no register alternative). For "rm" constraints, lower as
a normal expression value, since the backend will classify as GpReg.
