Task: Consolidate duplicated backend code (peephole utils, linker helpers)

Three areas of duplication being cleaned up:

1. Peephole optimizer string utilities (is_ident_char, replace_whole_word,
   replace_source_reg_in_instruction) duplicated between ARM and RISC-V backends.
   Extract to shared module.

2. LineStore abstraction duplicated between x86 and i686 peephole optimizers.
   Extract to shared module.

3. x86 linker private w32/w64/write_bytes/wphdr functions that duplicate
   shared versions already in elf.rs. Remove and use shared versions.

4. gc_collect_sections duplicated identically between x86 and ARM linkers.
   Move to linker_common.rs.
