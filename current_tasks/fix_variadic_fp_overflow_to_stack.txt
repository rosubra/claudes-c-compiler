Task: Fix variadic float/double overflow args going to GP registers instead of stack
Status: IN PROGRESS

Problem:
In classify_call_args(), when a float/double argument exceeds the available FP registers
(8 XMM regs on x86-64), the argument incorrectly falls through to the integer register
branch instead of going to the stack. This causes wrong values when va_arg retrieves
overflow floating-point arguments.

Fix:
Add an explicit branch for float args that don't fit in FP registers to go directly to
CallArgClass::Stack, rather than falling through to the GP register path.

Affected tests: compiler_suite_0080_0012, 0080_0013, 0080_0014, 0081_0011, 0081_0012,
and other va_arg tests with >8 FP arguments.
