Fix RISC-V assembler: symbol difference expressions in .word/.long/.quad directives

The builtin RISC-V assembler incorrectly handles expressions like:
    .word .LBB81 - .Ljt_23

Currently it emits a single R_RISCV_32 absolute relocation (for the first
symbol only, ignoring the subtracted part), which causes linker errors:
  "relocation R_RISCV_32 against non-absolute symbol can not be used in RV64"

The fix is to either:
1. Resolve the difference locally when both symbols are in the same section, or
2. Emit R_RISCV_ADD32 + R_RISCV_SUB32 relocation pairs for cross-section refs.

GCC's assembler uses ADD32/SUB32 pairs for these. Since our codegen emits these
for jump tables (same section, .rodata), local resolution is the simplest fix.
