Task: Implement wide string literal (L"...") support

Currently L"..." strings are parsed as regular narrow strings, losing the wide prefix.
This means wchar_t x[] = L"hello" gets the wrong size (defaults to 256 elements)
and wrong contents (stores narrow char bytes instead of wchar_t values).

Fix needed:
1. Add WideStringLiteral token kind and AST variant
2. Parse L"..." as WideStringLiteral preserving the content
3. Fix unsized array fixup for wide string initializers
4. Emit wide string data as 4-byte (wchar_t) values in local and global init
5. Fix sizeof for wide string literals

Affects ~668 test files that use L"..." syntax.
