Task: Add GCC passthrough for -m16 mode
Status: in_progress

Goal: When -m16 is used, delegate compilation to GCC instead of using the
internal compiler. The i686 backend produces code that is too large for the
32KB real mode limit used by Linux kernel boot code. As a temporary hack,
-m16 files will be compiled by i686-linux-gnu-gcc -m16 instead.

This unblocks building the Linux kernel for booting Doom.
