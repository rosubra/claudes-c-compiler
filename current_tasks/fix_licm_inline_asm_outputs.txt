Fix LICM pass to track inline assembly output operands

Problem: LICM (Loop Invariant Code Motion) incorrectly hoists loads from allocas
that are written to by inline assembly instructions. The analyze_loop_memory and
all_operand_values functions don't consider InlineAsm output pointers, causing:
1. Alloca not marked as stored-to (invisible to analyze_loop_memory)
2. Alloca not marked as address-taken (invisible to all_operand_values)

This causes do-while loops with inline asm writing to loop condition variables
to become infinite loops (the condition is hoisted before the loop and never
re-evaluated).

Fix: Track InlineAsm output pointers in both analyze_loop_memory and
all_operand_values in src/passes/licm.rs.

Affected tests:
- asm-cmpxchg8b-x86-003-run2 (x86 timeout)
- asm-shift-add-riscv-001-run2 (RISC-V timeout)
