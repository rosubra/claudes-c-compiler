Project Verification Triage
============================

Status of all 16 verification targets as of 2026-01-27.
Failures are based on running verify_*.py scripts.

  - zlib:          PASS (all backends)

  - mquickjs:      PASS (all backends)
  - libpng:        PASS (all backends — fixed ARM build by not defining __ARM_NEON)
  - libjpeg-turbo: PASS (all backends)

KERNEL STATUS:
  Linux kernel:
    x86:    PASS (builds and boots)
    ARM:    PASS (builds and boots)
    RISC-V: BUILD PASS, BOOT FAIL (not a compiler bug)
      Build: Fixed 2026-01-27. Three bugs were preventing the RISC-V kernel
             vDSO from building:
             1. Missing dep file in -E mode: -Wp,-MMD,<depfile> was not
                generating the dependency file when preprocessing .S files,
                causing fixdep to fail.
             2. Missing -Wa, flag passthrough: -Wa,-misa-spec=2.2 was not
                forwarded to the assembler when compiling C code, causing
                csrr instructions from vgettimeofday.c inline asm to fail.
             3. Missing -include/-nostdinc/-U flag passthrough: force-include
                files, -nostdinc, and -U flags were not forwarded when
                delegating .S preprocessing to gcc, causing CONFIG_* macros
                to remain unresolved in vdso.lds.
      Boot:  Kernel boots but hangs before login prompt. This is NOT a
             compiler bug — GCC-compiled kernel also fails the same way.
             Root cause: verify_kernel.py's tinyconfig doesn't enable
             CONFIG_FPU, but the busybox-riscv64 binary uses double-float
             ABI (lp64d). Need to add CONFIG_FPU to required_opts for RISC-V
             in verify_kernel.py.
    Action: Fix verify_kernel.py to enable CONFIG_FPU for RISC-V.

FAILING:
  liburing:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Builds but all 5 runtime tests fail. io_uring_queue_init
           returns -1 (EPERM). This is likely a Docker/kernel limitation
           rather than a compiler bug.
    Action: Low priority. Verify by running the test with GCC-compiled
            binary — if it also fails, this is an environment issue.

  postgres:
    Status: MOSTLY FIXED (213/216 tests pass)
    Notes: Fixed sizeof() on unsized arrays (declared with []) returning pointer
           size (8) instead of actual array size. The bug was in fixup_unsized_array
           which updated alloc_size but not c_type, leaving it as Array(elem, None).
           sizeof_identifier for globals preferred c_type, and Array(_, None).size_ctx()
           returned 8. This caused pg_char_to_encoding's lengthof(pg_encname_tbl) to
           return 0, making all encoding lookups fail and initdb crash.
           Previously also fixed typedef pointer cast arithmetic (132 failures).
           Remaining 3 failures:
           1. stats_ext: statistics estimation difference (100 vs 1000)
           2. plpgsql: stack depth exceeded (recurse test)
           3. One test triggers segfault (signal 11)
    Action: Investigate stats_ext estimation and stack depth issues.

PRIORITY ORDER for fixing:
  1. Fix verify_kernel.py RISC-V boot (add CONFIG_FPU to required_opts)
  2. Fix remaining postgres failures (stats_ext, plpgsql, segfault)
  3. Verify liburing is an environment issue
