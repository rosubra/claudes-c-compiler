Project Verification Triage
============================

Status of all 16 verification targets as of 2026-01-25.
Failures are based on running verify_*.py scripts.

PASSING (13):
  - zlib:          PASS (all backends)
  - lua:           PASS (all backends)
  - libsodium:     PASS (all backends — fixed GEP fold i128 bug)
  - mquickjs:      PASS (all backends)
  - libpng:        PASS (all backends)
  - libjpeg-turbo: PASS (all backends)
  - sqlite:        PASS (all backends, 622/622 sqllogictest)
  - libuv:         PASS (all backends)
  - redis:         PASS (all backends)
  - libffi:        PASS (all backends)
  - musl:          PASS (all backends)
  - tcc:           PASS (all backends)
  - jq:            PASS (all backends — fixed exponential const eval hang)

PARTIAL:
  mbedtls:
    Status: PARTIAL (6/7 tests pass; ARIA-ECB-128 encryption fails)
    Notes: md5, sha256, sha512, aes, rsa, ecp all pass now.
           Fixed inline asm callee-saved register preservation which
           was corrupting rbx across bn_mul.h multiply-accumulate calls.
           Remaining failure: ARIA-ECB-128 (enc) in selftest suite.
           Root cause: ARIA_P1 macro double-evaluates __builtin_bswap32,
           and after GVN merges the two calls, the register allocator
           assigns overlapping live intervals to the same register,
           causing the second bswap to undo the first.
    Action: Fix register allocator liveness analysis for bswap/callee-saved
            register conflicts. See ideas/fix_aria_bswap_regalloc.txt.

FAILING:
  liburing:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Builds but all 5 runtime tests fail. io_uring_queue_init
           returns -1 (EPERM). This is likely a Docker/kernel limitation
           rather than a compiler bug.
    Action: Low priority. Verify by running the test with GCC-compiled
            binary — if it also fails, this is an environment issue.

  postgres:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Builds successfully. initdb fails at runtime.
    Action: Debug initdb crash. Compare with GCC-compiled initdb.

PRIORITY ORDER for fixing:
  1. Fix mbedtls ARIA regalloc issue (6/7 passing, one remaining failure)
  2. Fix postgres initdb (complex, low priority)
  3. Verify liburing is an environment issue
