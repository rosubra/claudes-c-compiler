Make mem2reg Re-runnable for Inlining
======================================
Priority: MEDIUM

Note: Function inlining is already implemented (always_inline, small static,
small static-inline). This idea is about improving mem2reg to better support
the inliner's output.

Issues with re-running mem2reg after inlining:
1. Parameter-alloca skip is positional (first N allocas = params). After
   inlining, callee parameter allocas are in the caller but aren't caller
   params. Fix: annotation-based detection (is_param flag on Alloca).
2. Entry-block-only alloca scanning. Inlined allocas may not be in the
   entry block. Fix: either hoist inlined allocas to entry (LLVM's approach)
   or scan all blocks.
3. No persisted next_value on IrFunction. Fix: store it on the function.
