Expand Sema to Produce Typed AST
==================================
Priority: HIGH

Steps 1 through 5.6 are complete:
- TypeContext in sema/type_context.rs
- ExprTypeChecker in sema/type_checker.rs with CType inference
- CType arithmetic methods (usual_arithmetic_conversion etc.) in common/types.rs
- ExprTypeMap: sema annotates every expression with its CType
- ConstMap: sema pre-computes compile-time constants via SemaConstEval
- Shared const_eval arithmetic in common/const_arith.rs and common/const_eval.rs
- Lowerer consumes sema type annotations and const map as O(1) fast paths

Remaining steps:

Step 6: Add actual type error diagnostics in sema
  - Sema should emit structured diagnostics for type mismatches, undeclared
    identifiers, invalid conversions, etc. instead of deferring to lowering panics.

Step 7: Simplify lowering to assume types are correct
  - With sema validating types, lowering can drop most of its type inference
    code and assume the AST is well-typed. Expected reduction: ~18K to ~12K lines.

Benefits:
- Type errors become diagnostics instead of IR lowering panics
- Clearer module boundary: sema validates, lowering emits
- Enables future type-system features and better error messages
