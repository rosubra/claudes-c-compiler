LOW PRIORITY: Structured error infrastructure follow-ups

COMPLETED (2026-01-28):
- Created DiagnosticEngine in common/error.rs with Diagnostic, Severity, source snippets
- Wired into parser: all 4 eprintln! error sites replaced with emit_error()
- Wired into sema: errors and warnings go through DiagnosticEngine
- Wired into preprocessor: #warning collected as warnings (not bare eprintln!)
- Driver threads DiagnosticEngine through parser -> sema pipeline
- Source snippet rendering with caret/underline using SourceManager::get_source_line()
- GCC-compatible output format: "file:line:col: error: message"

COMPLETED (2026-01-28):
- Added WarningKind enum with categorized warnings (Undeclared, ImplicitFunctionDeclaration, Cpp)
- Added WarningConfig for per-warning enable/disable and error promotion
- Implemented -Werror (global), -Werror=<name>, -Wno-error=<name> for selective promotion
- Implemented -Wall, -Wextra, -W<name>, -Wno-<name> for warning control
- Left-to-right flag processing matching GCC semantics
- GCC-style [-W<name>] and [-Werror=<name>] suffixes on diagnostic messages
- Updated sema and preprocessor warning sites with WarningKind tags
- Wired WarningConfig from CLI through Driver to DiagnosticEngine

COMPLETED (2026-01-28):
- Added source spans to all 3 sema diagnostic sites:
  - "switch quantity is not an integer" error now includes the expression span
  - "'name' undeclared" warning now includes the identifier span
  - "implicit declaration of function 'name'" warning now includes the callee span
- Removed legacy `errors: Vec<String>` from SemanticAnalyzer; now uses
  DiagnosticEngine.has_errors() / error_count() exclusively
- Changed analyze() return type from Result<(), Vec<String>> to Result<(), usize>
- Added first "note:" follow-up message: switch type error now includes
  "note: expression has type 'Foo'" with span pointing to the expression
- Removed #[allow(dead_code)] from Diagnostic::with_note() (now in active use)

COMPLETED (2026-01-28):
- Wired DiagnosticEngine into the IR lowering phase:
  - Added DiagnosticEngine field (RefCell-wrapped) to Lowerer struct
  - Driver threads DiagnosticEngine: parser -> sema -> lowerer pipeline
  - Lowerer::lower() returns (IrModule, DiagnosticEngine) tuple
  - Driver checks for lowering errors after IR generation
  - Added emit_warning() helper using RefCell for interior mutability
    (many lowering methods take &self, same pattern as expr_ctype_cache)
  - Added diagnostics for unresolved typeof expressions (was a TODO)
  - Added diagnostics for __auto_type inference failures
  - All diagnostics include source spans for GCC-compatible location output

COMPLETED (2026-01-28):
- Added Display impl for CType in common/types.rs to show user-friendly C-style
  type names in diagnostics (e.g., "unsigned int" instead of "UInt", "char *"
  instead of "Pointer(Char)", "void (*)(int)" for function pointers)
- Updated sema diagnostic site to use Display (format with {}) instead of Debug ({:?})
  for CType in the "expression has type '...'" note message

COMPLETED (2026-01-30):
- Added fix-it hint infrastructure: Diagnostic.fix_hint field rendered below snippets
- Added expect_after() parser method for context-aware error messages
  (e.g., "expected ';' after return statement" instead of "expected ';' before '}'")
- Added expect_closing() parser method for delimiter matching notes
  (e.g., "note: to match this '(' at file.c:10:5")
- Updated all statement semicolons with context: return, break, continue, goto,
  do-while, for-loop, expression statements
- Updated struct/enum/initializer closing braces with opening brace notes
- Updated function calls, parenthesized expressions, array subscripts,
  _Alignof, __alignof__, __builtin_va_arg, __builtin_types_compatible_p,
  _Generic, _Static_assert with closing paren notes
- Updated declaration semicolons (external, local, K&R params, struct fields)

REMAINING FOLLOW-UPS:
1. Add spans to preprocessor errors (#error directives)
2. Add more WarningKind categories as compiler implements more warnings
   (UnusedVariable, ReturnType, SignCompare, ImplicitConversion, etc.)
3. Add more "note:" follow-ups: "previous declaration was here", "did you mean to include <header>?"
4. Add more lowering diagnostics: unresolved lvalue in assignments, unresolved typedefs,
   vector type mismatches in compound assignment
