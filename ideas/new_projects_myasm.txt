| Project | x86 | i686 | arm | riscv | Notes |
|---------|-----|------|-----|-------|-------|
| lz4     | PASS | PASS | FAIL | FAIL | i686 fixed by local symbol reloc fix |
| libyaml | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | i686 fixed by local symbol reloc fix |
| tomlc99 | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | i686 fixed by local symbol reloc fix |
| parson  | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | i686 fixed by local symbol reloc fix |
| jsmn    | PASS | PASS | N/A  | N/A  | Fixed i686: IFUNC support (IPLT/IRELATIVE), TLS, local sym resolution, generic section writes |
| zstd    | PASS | TODO | TODO | TODO | Fixed __ASSEMBLER__ for .S files, .pushsection/.popsection, BMI2 instrs, bitwise expr parsing |
| 8cc     | PASS | FAIL (i686 asm undefined syms) | TODO | TODO | Fixed x86 builtin linker copy-reloc st_shndx and .gnu.hash |
| bzip2   | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | i686 fixed by local symbol reloc fix |
| miniz   | PASS | FAIL (i686 asm) | PASS | PASS | i686 still fails (different issue) |
| utf8proc | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | i686 fixed by local symbol reloc fix |
| chibicc | PASS | TODO | TODO | TODO | Passes x86 |
| QuickJS | PASS | TODO | TODO | TODO | Passes x86 |
| cJSON   | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | All arches pass with builtin asm/ld |
| monocypher | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | Fixed ARM asm: symbol names matching register names (e.g. x16) |
| sundown | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | All architectures pass out of the box |
| termbox | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | All architectures pass out of the box |
| dash    | PASS | FAIL | PASS | FAIL | Fixed x86: COPY reloc weak alias resolution (environ/__environ) |
| cmark   | PASS | FAIL (i686 group info) | PASS | PASS | Fixed x86/riscv asm octal escape parsing (\0 prefix consumed too early) |
| Duktape | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | Passes all architectures out of the box |
| Wren    | PASS | TODO | TODO | TODO | Passes x86 (minor flaky timing tests, pass on retry) |
| json-c  | PASS | FAIL (asm issue) | PASS | PASS | Fixed i686 linker local symbol collision (GOTOFF relocations); i686 passes with GCC asm + builtin LD; builtin asm still has issues |
