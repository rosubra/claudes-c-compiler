MEDIUM PRIORITY: Remaining backend codegen deduplication opportunities

Items 1 and 2 have been completed:
- CastKind enum + classify_cast() extracts shared cast classification (Ptr normalization,
  F128 reduction, float/int/widen/narrow dispatch) into codegen_shared.rs
- classify_float_binop() + FloatOp enum fixes the latent fadd-fallback bug and shares
  the float operation dispatch across all three backends

Items 1, 2, and 4 have been completed:
- CastKind enum + classify_cast() extracts shared cast classification
- classify_float_binop() + FloatOp enum shares float operation dispatch
- ARM operand_to_x0 movz/movk inlining deduplicated via emit_load_imm64 (I64/F32/F64/LongDouble)
- ARM emit_sub_sp/emit_add_sp simplified to use emit_load_imm64 for large offsets
- ARM emit_inline_asm const loading simplified to use emit_load_imm64

Remaining opportunities:

3. Parameter classification: emit_store_params and emit_call all independently classify
   params as int-reg/float-reg/stack. A shared classify_params() helper could reduce this,
   but the three ABIs differ significantly (x86-64 SysV, AAPCS64, RISC-V LP64D), so the
   benefit is lower than items 1-2.

5. emit_memcpy: ARM and RISC-V share the same loop algorithm but differ in addressing
   modes (ARM post-increment vs RISC-V explicit pointer advance). x86 uses rep movsb.
   The savings are marginal (~10 lines) since the loop bodies are structurally different.
