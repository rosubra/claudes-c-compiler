MEDIUM PRIORITY: Remaining backend codegen deduplication opportunities

Items 1 and 2 have been completed:
- CastKind enum + classify_cast() extracts shared cast classification (Ptr normalization,
  F128 reduction, float/int/widen/narrow dispatch) into codegen_shared.rs
- classify_float_binop() + FloatOp enum fixes the latent fadd-fallback bug and shares
  the float operation dispatch across all three backends

Remaining opportunities:

3. Parameter classification: emit_store_params and emit_call all independently classify
   params as int-reg/float-reg/stack. A shared classify_params() helper could reduce this,
   but the three ABIs differ significantly (x86-64 SysV, AAPCS64, RISC-V LP64D), so the
   benefit is lower than items 1-2.

4. ARM-specific: load_large_imm helper exists but operand_to_x0 manually inlines the same
   movz+movk pattern 4 times. va_arg/va_start bypass large-offset helpers.

5. emit_memcpy: ARM and RISC-V both have nearly identical loop-based memcpy implementations.
   Could extract a shared "emit loop-based memcpy" into the ArchCodegen trait with
   arch-specific register names as parameters.
