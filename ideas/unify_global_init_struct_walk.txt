Unify global init struct traversal with trait-based emitter pattern

The global init subsystem has the same struct-field-traversal algorithm implemented
in 3 separate functions, each targeting a different output format:

1. fill_struct_global_bytes() -> writes to &mut [u8] byte buffer
2. lower_struct_global_init_compound() -> writes to Vec<GlobalInit> elements
3. fill_struct_array_sequential() + fill_nested_struct_with_ptrs() ->
   writes scalars to bytes + collects pointer relocations in Vec<(usize, GlobalInit)>

All three independently implement: field index resolution via designators, union
single-field semantics, bitfield packing, padding/zero-fill, and nested struct
recursion. Every bug fix or new designator feature must be applied in 3+ places.

Recommended approach: Create an InitEmitter trait with methods for emitting scalars,
pointers, and zero-fill. Implement ByteEmitter, CompoundEmitter, and HybridEmitter.
Write one walk_struct_init function that works with any emitter.

The drill_designators() shared helper was already extracted (replacing 5 duplicated
designator chain walkers). This next step would unify the remaining ~300 lines of
duplicated field traversal logic.

Estimated savings: ~200-300 lines net reduction, plus correctness-by-construction
benefit of having one traversal algorithm instead of three.
