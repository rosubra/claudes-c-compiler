LOW PRIORITY: Remaining refactoring of large functions in IR lowering module

Items 1, 2, 3, 4b, 4c have been completed:
- try_lower_atomic_builtin: table-driven dispatch (classify_fetch_op, classify_op_fetch)
- fill_struct_global_bytes: 15+ extracted helpers, reduced nesting from 7-8 to 3-4 levels
- lower_global_init: typed_zero_const(), maybe_promote_long_double() helpers
- Global init subsystem extracted to global_init.rs (1950+ lines, 44 functions)
- Shared helpers extracted: resolve_typedef_derived(), register_function_meta(),
  intern_string_literal(), push_zero_bytes() - eliminating 18+ duplication sites

Item 4 completed:
- get_expr_type: merged two sequential match blocks into a single unified dispatch

Additional dedup completed in expr.rs:
- fp_masks() helper centralizes FP bit-layout constants (abs_mask, exp_only, exp_shift, etc.)
- fp_abs_bits() helper deduplicates abs-value computation across isnan/isinf/isinf_sign
- mask_float_sign_for_truthiness() deduplicates sign-bit masking in lower_condition_expr
  and LogicalNot

Remaining (lower priority, less severe):

5. lower_function (lowering.rs, ~340 lines)
   - Could be split into: lower_function_params, lower_function_body, emit_implicit_return
   - But the function has clear phase comments and reasonable structure
