LOW PRIORITY: Remaining lowering function refactoring opportunities

Completed:
- lower_local_decl (stmt.rs): decomposed from 552 lines to ~130 lines via stmt_init.rs helpers
- lower_stmt Return arm: decomposed from 194 lines to 4 lines via stmt_return.rs
- Duplicated scope-tracking pattern: extracted to shadow_local_for_scope/shadow_static_for_scope
- Duplicated function meta registration: extracted to register_block_func_meta
- Removed unnecessary cond_label_ref clone in for-loop lowering
- lower_function (lowering.rs): decomposed from 554 lines into orchestrator + 5 sub-methods
  (compute_function_return_type, build_ir_params, allocate_function_params,
  handle_kr_float_promotion, finalize_function) with ParamKind/IrParamBuildResult types
- Triplicated fptr typedef detection: extracted to shared extract_func_typedef_info and
  extract_fptr_typedef_info helpers, used by both pass 0 (collect_all_typedefs) and stmt.rs
- Pass 0 inline typedef collection: extracted to collect_all_typedefs() method

Remaining (diminishing returns):
- emit_struct_init (stmt.rs, ~438 lines): complex but inherently so due to C designated
  initializer spec. Could extract CType::Array arms but adds indirection without clarity gain
