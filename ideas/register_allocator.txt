Register Allocator Improvements
===============================

The three-phase linear scan allocator is implemented on all three backends:
- x86-64: rbx, r12-r15 (callee) + r11, r10, r8, r9 (caller) = 9 registers
- AArch64: x20-x28 (callee) + x13, x14 (caller) = 11 registers
- RISC-V: s1, s7-s11 (callee) = 6 registers

Liveness analysis uses backward dataflow iteration with loop awareness.
ARM skips variadic functions to avoid callee-save/VA-save area conflicts.

Remaining improvements:
1. Eliminate write-through: skip the stack store when the value is
   register-allocated and has no other readers.
2. Register-to-register operations: emit ops directly on callee-saved
   registers instead of routing through the accumulator.
3. Spill/reload insertion: move values between registers and stack at
   optimal points instead of falling back to the stack slot.
4. Call-clobber handling: insert saves around clobbering instructions
   instead of bailing out for functions with inline asm or atomics.
5. ARM variadic support: handle callee-save area placement relative
   to VA register save areas.
