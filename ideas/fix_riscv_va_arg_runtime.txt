RISC-V va_arg Remaining Issues
===============================

Five items previously fixed (register save area layout, named float params,
va_list parameter passing, register allocation awareness, multi-register
param counting). Two issues remain:

1. Struct arguments in variadic calls are passed by pointer instead of by value.
   Small structs (<= 2*XLEN = 16 bytes) should be flattened into GP registers
   at the call site. Affects struct va_arg (e.g., va_arg(ap, struct { float f; })).
   Fix needed in: IR lowering of call args or backend emit_call.

2. Long double (f128) va_arg may have alignment issues for structs containing
   long double members.
