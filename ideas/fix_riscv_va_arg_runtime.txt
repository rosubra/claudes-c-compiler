PARTIALLY FIXED: RISC-V va_arg runtime correctness

FIXED: Register save area layout for variadic functions.
The register save area (a0-a7) is now placed at positive offsets from s0
(contiguous with the caller's stack-passed arguments), fixing the core issue
where va_arg would walk off into local variable space when exhausting the
register save area.

FIXED: Named float parameters in variadic functions.
Float/double named params are now correctly handled as GP register args
in variadic functions (per RISC-V LP64D ABI: all args to variadic functions
go through integer registers).

REMAINING ISSUES:
1. Struct arguments in variadic calls are passed by pointer instead of by value.
   Small structs (<= 2*XLEN = 16 bytes) should be flattened into GP registers
   at the call site. This affects struct va_arg (e.g., va_arg(ap, struct { float f; })).
   Fix needed in: IR lowering of call args (lower_call_arguments) or backend emit_call.

2. Long double (f128) va_arg may have alignment issues for structs containing
   long double members.

3. va_list passed as function parameter or global variable may have issues
   if the va_list type representation differs from expectations.
