Struct/union feature improvements needed:

Remaining work:
1. Struct copy/assignment (s1 = s2): Need to emit memcpy-style code
   for struct-to-struct assignment. Currently only field-by-field access works.

2. Struct return values: Functions returning structs need the hidden first
   parameter (sret) ABI handling.

3. Nested struct initialization: Basic cases work. Multi-dimensional arrays of
   char * pointers (e.g., char *c[2][1][1][1][3]) need more work.

4. Anonymous structs/unions as members.

5. Bitfield access (partially working but needs proper mask/shift).

6. Array members in structs (e.g., struct { int arr[10]; }).
   Need proper layout and GEP for arr[i] within the struct.

Completed:
- Struct passing to functions (all three backends: x86, ARM, RISC-V)
- Designated initializers (most cases including nested, compound literals)
- Struct layout scoping (local struct defs properly shadow globals)
