Struct/union feature improvements needed:

1. Struct copy/assignment (s1 = s2): Need to emit memcpy-style code
   for struct-to-struct assignment. Currently only field-by-field access works.

2. Struct passing to functions: The ABI requires structs larger than 16 bytes
   to be passed by pointer (hidden first argument). Small structs need to be
   passed in registers per the SysV AMD64 ABI classification rules.

3. Struct return values: Functions returning structs need the hidden first
   parameter (sret) ABI handling.

4. Designated initializers: Basic field designators work. Complex cases still failing:
   - .t.a[1] = {1,2,3} (nested struct + array index + brace-list value)
   - Compound literal with designators: (struct s){ {.a[1]=2,8} }
   Note: Array-of-pointer fields with designated init (.a[1]="abc") now work.

5. Nested struct initialization: Basic cases work. Multi-dimensional arrays of
   char * pointers (e.g., char *c[2][1][1][1][3]) need more work.

6. Anonymous structs/unions as members.

7. Bitfield access (partially working but needs proper mask/shift).

8. Array members in structs (e.g., struct { int arr[10]; }).
   Need proper layout and GEP for arr[i] within the struct.
