Struct/Union Edge Cases
========================

Core struct/union functionality is implemented and working (the compiler
builds PostgreSQL, SQLite, musl, tcc, etc.). This includes:
- Struct copy/assignment via memcpy
- Struct return values (sret ABI)
- Nested struct initialization (including designated initializers)
- Anonymous structs/unions
- Bitfield access (mask/shift)
- Array members in structs
- Struct passing to functions on all backends

Remaining edge cases:
- Multi-dimensional arrays of pointers in nested initializers
  (e.g., char *c[2][1][1][1][3]) may have issues
- Some packed struct + bitfield interactions may fail
- Complex nested anonymous union/struct access paths
