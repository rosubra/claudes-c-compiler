Compile Speed Improvements
===========================
Priority: HIGH

Profiled on sqlite3.c (2550 functions, 694K tokens, 22MB asm output).

Remaining bottlenecks:

1. EXTERNAL ASSEMBLER (~26% of total time)
   The compiler shells out to gcc/as for assembling text assembly into
   object files. This is the single biggest time consumer.
   Fix: Native assembler + ELF writer (see native_elf_writer.txt).
   Expected improvement: ~30-40%.

2. ALLOCATION OVERHEAD (~7.7% of total)
   malloc/free/realloc from ir::analysis::build_cfg, GVN, mem2reg.
   Partially fixed: build_cfg uses FlatAdj CSR format, CFG/dominator
   analysis is shared across GVN/LICM/IVSR via CfgAnalysis.
   Further: arena/bump allocators, reuse Vec buffers across functions.

3. STRING COMPARISON (~3.4% of total)
   memcmp in peephole dead store elimination (O(n^2) str::contains),
   preprocessor macro expansion, backend symbol lookups.
   Parser typedef lookup fixed (FxHashSet).
   Fix: String interning with u32 symbol IDs.

4. PEEPHOLE OPTIMIZER (~1.5%)
   Dead store elimination has O(n^2) behavior scanning assembly lines.
   Fix: Hash-based store location index for O(n) dead store elimination.

The native assembler (item 1) is by far the highest-impact change.
