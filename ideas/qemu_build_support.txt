QEMU Build Support
==================

Status: Configure passes, full build not yet tested.

The Meson build system now correctly detects our compiler as GCC 14.2.0
and passes all QEMU configure-time checks. The only configure failure was
a missing git submodule (keycodemapdb) which is a setup issue, not a
compiler issue.

Next steps to complete QEMU build support:
1. Set up QEMU with all submodules (git submodule init/update)
2. Run `make -j64` to identify any compilation failures
3. Fix specific C features/edge cases that QEMU uses but we don't support
4. Run QEMU test suite to verify correctness
5. Test with multiple QEMU target configurations (not just x86_64-softmmu)

Known potential issues:
- QEMU uses complex preprocessor macros and GCC extensions extensively
- QEMU may use GCC builtins we don't implement (e.g., __builtin_clz family,
  __atomic_* operations, __sync_* operations)
- QEMU may use statement expressions ({...}) and other GCC extensions
- QEMU may use _Pragma, __attribute__((cleanup)), etc.
- The _Float* types are currently mapped to standard C types via macros
  which loses precision for _Float128 on x86-64

Priority: HIGH - QEMU is a major milestone for the compiler
