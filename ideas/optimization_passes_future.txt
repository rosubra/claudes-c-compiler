Future Optimization Passes
===========================
Priority: MEDIUM

Currently implemented passes:
- constant_fold.rs        Constant folding and propagation
- copy_prop.rs            Copy propagation
- dce.rs                  Dead code elimination
- gvn.rs                  Dominator-based GVN/CSE
- simplify.rs             Algebraic simplification, strength reduction
- cfg_simplify.rs         Dead block removal, jump threading
- licm.rs                 Loop-invariant code motion
- inline.rs               Function inlining (always_inline + small static)
- if_convert.rs           Diamond if-then-else to conditional moves
- narrow.rs               Integer narrowing
- div_by_const.rs         Division by constant strength reduction
- ipcp.rs                 Interprocedural constant propagation
- iv_strength_reduce.rs   Induction variable strength reduction

Shared infrastructure:
- ir/analysis.rs: CFG, dominator tree (Cooper-Harvey-Kennedy), dominance
  frontiers. Used by mem2reg, GVN, LICM, IVSR.

Next passes to add:
1. SCCP (Sparse Conditional Constant Propagation): propagate constants
   through the CFG taking branch conditions into account.

2. Loop strength reduction extensions: extend iv_strength_reduce to handle
   pointer-based induction variables and more complex patterns.
