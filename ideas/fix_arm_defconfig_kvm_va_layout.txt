Fix ARM64 defconfig: KVM va_layout BUG in kvm_update_va_mask

The ARM64 defconfig kernel crashes during boot with:
  kernel BUG at arch/arm64/kvm/va_layout.c:182!
  pc : kvm_update_va_mask+0x298/0x38c

The BUG_ON fires because compute_instruction() returns AARCH64_BREAK_FAULT,
meaning aarch64_insn_gen_logical_immediate() failed to encode the va_mask
as a logical immediate. This indicates va_mask has an invalid value (0 or
all-ones) at runtime.

Root cause is likely a CCC codegen bug in kvm_compute_layout(), which
computes va_mask using:
  tag_lsb = fls64(phys_to_virt(memblock_start_of_DRAM()) ^ (high_memory - 1));
  va_mask = GENMASK_ULL(tag_lsb - 1, 0);

The function involves complex bit manipulation using vabits_actual (derived
from TCR_EL1), fls64/__builtin_clzl, and GENMASK_ULL. GCC produces much
more compact code for this function (97 lines vs CCC's 480+), suggesting
CCC may have a codegen issue with the bitwise operations, TCR_EL1 register
read, or the fls64 always_inline chain.

This crash is pre-existing (not caused by the inline fix) but was previously
masked by earlier crashes (cpucap BRK at boot, rmqueue_bulk stack overflow).

Debugging steps:
1. Compare CCC vs GCC disassembly of kvm_compute_layout byte-by-byte
2. Check if TCR_EL1 MRS lowering is correct
3. Check GENMASK_ULL macro expansion and bit shifting operations
4. Test with a standalone C program that exercises the same bit patterns
