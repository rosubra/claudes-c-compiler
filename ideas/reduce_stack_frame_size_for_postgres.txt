Reduce Stack Frame Size for PostgreSQL
=======================================

PostgreSQL's plpgsql "recursion_test(4,3)" fails with "stack depth limit
exceeded" at max_stack_depth=2048kB. Our stack frames are ~3.8x larger
than GCC's.

Root causes:
1. Every SSA temporary gets an 8-byte stack slot, even for i32/i16/i8 types.
2. Intermediate SSA values from expression evaluation each get their own slot.

Remaining fixes:
1. Use 4-byte slots for i32 and smaller types (HIGH IMPACT)
   - Change slot_size computation in calculate_stack_space_common
   - Requires changes to store/load paths in all 3 backends
   - Could reduce frame sizes by ~40%

2. Skip slot allocation for single-use values consumed immediately (HIGH IMPACT)
   - If a value is defined at instruction N and only used at N+1, it doesn't
     need a stack slot (stays in accumulator register)
   - Could eliminate 30-50% of slots

Note: Caller-saved register allocation is now done on all three backends.
