Fix postgres catcache lookup failure on RISC-V
================================================

Status: ARM is FIXED (32-bit shift sign extension bug). RISC-V still fails.

ARM fix: The ARM backend was missing sign extension (sxtw) after 32-bit Shl
and AShr operations. When the narrowing pass narrowed an I64 shift to I32,
the ARM codegen emitted `lsl w0, w1, w2` which zero-extends to x0. Subsequent
64-bit operations (like AShr by 63 from div_by_const expansion) saw the wrong
sign, causing negative values to be treated as large positive numbers. This
caused numeric ln() to hang (infinite loop in sqrt reduction) which made
make check time out.

RISC-V issue: PostgreSQL still fails make check on RISC-V. The failure mode
may be different since RISC-V W-suffix instructions naturally sign-extend.
Need to investigate separately.

Original problem description (now applies to RISC-V only):
  PostgreSQL builds and initdb succeeds on RISC-V, but "make check"
  fails. The exact failure mode should be re-investigated.

Debugging approach:
  1. Run make check with longer timeout on RISC-V
  2. Check regression.diffs for the specific test failure
  3. If it's also a numeric/catcache issue, look at RISC-V-specific codegen
  4. Compile specific postgres files with GCC and our compiler, swap them
     one at a time to isolate which source file contains the miscompilation
