Remaining issues with static/inline functions:

1. Our compiler sometimes generates BSS globals for local variables declared
   inside blocks within switch cases and macro expansions. For example,
   'int cond;' inside a { } block might be emitted as a global BSS symbol.
   This is likely a parser/codegen scope issue with variable declarations
   inside nested blocks.

2. DONE: Static inline function inlining is now implemented. always_inline,
   small static inline, and small static functions are all inlined. The kernel
   objtool validation issue is resolved.
