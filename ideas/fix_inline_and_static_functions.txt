BSS globals for block-scoped local variables
=============================================

The compiler sometimes generates BSS globals for local variables declared
inside blocks within switch cases and macro expansions. For example,
'int cond;' inside a { } block might be emitted as a global BSS symbol.
This is likely a parser/codegen scope issue with variable declarations
inside nested blocks.

Note: static inline function inlining is fully implemented (always_inline,
small static inline, small static). See completed_tasks/.
